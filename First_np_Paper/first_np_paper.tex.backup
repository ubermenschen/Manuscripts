% \comment{Need Daniel's middle initial} - he doesn't have one







Cross sections for the \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc} and \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} reactions have been measured for quasi-monoenergetic DD neutrons produced by the UC-Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator. The study was motivated by interest in the production of \ce{^{47}Sc} and \ce{^{64}Cu} as emerging medical isotopes. The cross sections were measured in ratio to the \ce{^{113}In}(n,n')\ce{^{113m}In} and \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In} inelastic scattering reactions on co-irradiated indium samples. Post-irradiation counting using an HPGe and LEPS detectors allowed for cross section determination to within 6\% uncertainty. The cross section were determined with lower uncertainty than existing measurements and are found to be  in good agreement with the literature and theoretical values. This work highlights the utility of using DD plasma-based neutron sources, for a host of nuclear data measurements and potentially for the production of radionuclides for medical applications.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

%
% If we want to mention in-situ-production
%
%
% e.g.:In-situ production (I always figured this is what is so great, correct me if I am wrong) of radioactive nuclides is an emerging method for radiation therapy in nuclear medicine (e.g., cite some recent review paper). It is based on doping the malignant target tissue with a stable nuclide which is then activated in-situ by neutron irradiation. Following decay is focused on the target tissue. Advantages compared to conventional radiation therapy are the reduction of damage to surrounding cells, … short range, … . Currently development of this technique is hampered by the lack of fundamental cross section data for various isotopes.

There has been significant interest in the past several years in exploring the use of neutron-induced reactions to create radionuclides for a wide range of applications, due to the far greater range of neutrons as compared to charged particle beams ($\sfrac{\text{g}}{\text{cm}^2}$ as compared to 10's of $\sfrac{\text{mg}}{\text{cm}^2}$), together with the fact that isotope production facilities often produce large secondary neutron fields.  Particular interest has been paid to (n,p) and (n,$\alpha$) charge-exchange reactions since these reactions produce high-specific activity radionuclide samples without the use of chemical carriers in the separation process.  

Two other potential neutron sources for (n,x) reactions exist in addition to the secondary neutron fields generated at existing isotope production facilities: reactors and neutron generators that utilize the D(T,n)$\alpha$ \enquote{DT} and D(D,n)\ce{^3He} \enquote{DD} reactions.  While reactors produce copious quantities of neutrons, their energy spectrum is often not well-suited to the preparation of high-purity samples due to the co-production of unwanted activities via neutron capture, in addition to the significant start-up costs and proliferation concerns involved in their commissioning \cite{Updegraff2013}.  Similarly, while the higher energy 14-15 MeV neutrons produced at DT generators are capable of initiating (n,p) and (n,$\alpha$) reactions, their higher energy opens the possibility of creating unwanted activities via (n,pxn) and (n,$\alpha$xn) reactions that cannot easily be separated from the desired radionuclides.  

In contrast, while the neutron spectrum from a DD reaction, which ranges from approximately 2-3 MeV, is ideally suited to radionuclide production, the lower flux from these generators limits their production rate.  An additional complication is the relative paucity of high-quality, consistent cross section data for neutrons in the 2-3 MeV DD energy range.  

The purpose of the present work is to explore the potential for using high-flux neutron generators to make high-specific activity samples of radionuclides at the mCi level for local use in the application community.  The research group at UC-Berkeley has been developing a High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG) that features an internal target where samples can be placed several mm from the neutron producing surface in order to maximize the utilization of each neutron for the production of a desired radionuclide \textcolor{red}{[XXXref Cory paper]}.  The HFNG uses the D(D,n)\ce{^3He} reaction to produce neutrons with energies near 2.45 MeV together with a self-loading target design to maintain continuous operation without target replacement.  In addition to the generator itself, efforts are underway to design neutron reflection capabilities to allow scattered neutrons multiple opportunities to interact with an  internally mounted target. While these design efforts are underway, the HFNG can be used to better characterize production cross sections at the appropriate neutron energy.

\comment{how can we cite Mauricio's/Cory's upcoming paper? We need a good reference for the HFNG.}

The present work features a pair of cross section measurements for the production of two non-standard positron emitters: \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} and \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc}. \ce{^{64}Cu}  ($t_{1/2}$ = 12.7 h) undergoes $\beta^+$ decay (61.5\% branching ratio) to \ce{^{64}Ni} or $\beta^-$ decay (38.5\% branching ratio) to \ce{^{64}Zn} \cite{Singh2007}. The emitted 190-keV $\beta^-$ particle makes this an  attractive short-range therapeutic radionuclide, which also has the possibility for simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for real-time dose monitoring and verification. This makes \ce{^{64}Cu} particularly attractive for emerging radiation therapy protocols \cite{Lewis2003,NSACIsotopesSubcommittee2015,Bandari2014,mp500671j}. In addition, copper radiochemistry is well developed, and many existing ligands and carriers may be used for selective delivery of the radionuclide to different sites in patients. The second radionuclide studied, \ce{^{47}Sc} ($t_{1/2}$ = 3.35 d), undergoes $\beta^-$ decay to \ce{^{47}Ti}, emitting a high-intensity 159-keV gamma ray in the process \cite{Burrows2007}. This radionuclide is  attractive as an emerging diagnostic isotope, due to the similarity of the emitted gamma ray to that of the more well-established \ce{^{99m}Tc} \cite{Qaim2011,Qaim201731,Kolsky1998,mausner1995evaluation}. However, due to the short half-life of and dwindling supplies of \ce{^{99m}Tc}, \ce{^{47}Sc} stands poised as a potential solution to this shortage, due to its longer half-life and multiple production pathways without the need for highly enriched uranium. In addition, when paired with \ce{^{44}Sc}, \ce{^{47}Sc} forms a promising \enquote{theranostic} set for use in simultaneous therapeutic and diagnostic applications \cite{Muller2014,Deilami-nezhad2016}.

% \comment{cite theranostic papers, etc}



Current methodology in radiochemistry has been proven to successfully recover upwards of 95\% of produced \ce{^{64}Cu}\cite{bhatki1969preparation,mirzadeh1992spontaneous} and \ce{^{47}Sc}\cite{Aly1971,Bokhari2010,BF02047448} from solid target designs, without the need for additional carrier. By expanding the base of efficient reaction pathways, great advances can be made in making production of medical radionuclides more efficient and affordable for those in need.

% Neutron activation was carried out via irradiation in the High-Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG), a DD neutron generator at the University of California, Berkeley, seen in  \autoref{fig:hfng_a}. This generator extracts deuterium ions from an RF-heated deuterium plasma through a nozzle, whose shape was designed to form a flat-profile beam 5 mm in diameter. This deuterium beam is incident upon a water-cooled, self-loading titanium-coated copper target, where the titanium layer acts as a reaction surface for DD fusion, producing neutrons with a well-known energy distribution as a function of  emission angle \cite{Liskien_Paulsen_1973}. Targets are inserted in the center of the target, approximately 8 mm from the DD reaction surface, prior to startup. \autoref{fig:hfng_b} displays a cut-away schematic of the HFNG. A 100 kV deuterium beam was extracted at 1.5 mA, creating a fluence of approximately  $\sci{1.3}{7}$ neutrons/cm$^2$ on the target.

\subsection{Cross section determination by relative activation}\label{sec:sample_loading}


The approach used in both measurements was to irradiate foils of zinc or titanium, which were co-loaded with indium foils in order to determine their (n,p) cross sections relative to the well-established \ce{^{113}In}(n,n')\ce{^{113m}In} and \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In} neutron dosimetry standards \cite{Capote2012,zsolnay2012technical}.   \autoref{tab:foil_specs} records physical characteristics of each foil for the various irradiations. In each experiment, the co-loaded foils were irradiated for 3 hours at nominal operating conditions of 1.3 mA and 100 kV.  After irradiation, the foils were removed and placed in front of an appropriate High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) gamma-ray detector and the decay gamma-rays were recorded in variable-time bins.

1 cm diameter, 1 mm thick natural abundance zinc and titanium targets were employed for the measurement. Each of these was  co-loaded with a natural abundance Indium foil of 1 cm diameter and 0.5 mm thickness in a recess cut into a 2-mm thick polyethylene holder, as seen in \autoref{fig:holder_a}, which was mounted in the HFNG target center. Prior to loading, each foil was washed with isopropanol and dried, to remove any trace oils or residue that could become activated during irradiation.

\subsection{Determination of effective neutron energy}\label{sec:neutron_energies}

The D(D,n)\ce{^3He} reaction at 100 keV lab energy produces neutrons with energies ranging from 
% 2.2 to 2.85 MeV   (thin-target Liskien values)
% 2.18 to 2.78 MeV  (Liskien thick-target coefficient corrections to above)
2.18 to 2.78 MeV, over an angular range of 0-180\degree\ in the lab frame-of-reference with respect to the incident deuteron beam. This distribution has been well documented \cite{Liskien_Paulsen_1973} and is shown in \autoref{fig:scatt_angle} for 100 keV incident deuteron energy.

The Monte Carlo N-Particle transport code  MCNP6 \cite{goorley2013initial} was used to model the neutron energy spectrum incident upon target foils co-loaded into the HFNG (see \autoref{fig:mcnp_flux}). This spectrum illustrates the forward-focused kinematics of the DD reaction subtended by the co-loaded sample foils.

While this shows that the sample foils experience a very narrow energy distribution of incident neutrons, an effective neutron energy window must be determined. The MCNP6 simulation shows an identical flux-weighted average neutron energy of 2.765 MeV for both the Indium and target foils to the 1 keV level. Due to the kinematics of DD neutron emission, $E_{max}$,  the maximum energy of a neutron subtending the target foils in this geometry is 2.783 MeV \cite{Liskien_Paulsen_1973}. For this maximum energy, the number of reactions induced in a foil (containing $N_i$ target nuclei) is given by:

\begin{equation}
R = N_i \int_0^{E_{max}} \sigma(E) \dfrac{d\phi}{dE} dE
\end{equation}


% \comment{Regex to replace equations with LaTeX formats, add cross-references.} % [E,e]quation[^*}]    }

From this definition, it is possible to calculate $F\pp{E'}$, the fraction of total reactions induced up to some energy $E' < E_{max}$:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:react_fraction}
F\pp{E'} = \dfrac{\int_0^{E'} \sigma(E) \dfrac{d\phi}{dE} dE}{\int_0^{E_{max}} \sigma(E) \dfrac{d\phi}{dE} dE}
\end{equation}

% \comment{Change \autoref{fig:frac_plot} text from the $\pm 1\sigma$ to 68.2\%, after using new A}

This quantity $F\pp{E'}$ is plotted in \autoref{fig:frac_plot}. The fraction of total reactions in the indium foil can be used to characterize the effective neutron energy bin.  Our approach, in analogy to the Gaussian quantity $\sigma$, will be to use a horizontal \enquote{error bar}  to represent the energy range responsible for 68.2\% of the reactions taking place.  Using this approach, we report the effective energy bin as being $E_n$ = 2.7645 MeV + 0.0151 MeV / - 0.0219 MeV.  This 37-keV full-energy spread verifies that, at such close distances to the DD reaction surface, loaded target foils receive a quasi-monoenergetic neutron flux.

\subsection{Measurement of induced activities}\label{sec:spectroscopy}

After irradiation, the co-loaded targets were removed from the HFNG and transferred to a counting lab, where their induced activities could be measured via gamma ray spectroscopy. Two detectors were used in this measurement. An Ortec 80\% High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector was used for the detection of the positron annihilation radiation from the \ce{^{64}Cu}  decay \cite{Singh2007}, the 391 keV gamma-ray from the \ce{^{113m}In}  isomer \cite{Blachot2010a}, and the 336 keV gamma-ray from the decay of the \ce{^{115m}In}  isomer \cite{Blachot2012}. An Ortec planar Low-Energy Photon Spectrometer (LEPS)  was used for the detection of the lower-energy 159 keV gamma-ray from \ce{^{47}Sc} \cite{Burrows2007} as well as the two indium isomers mentioned above. Both detectors were calibrated for energy and efficiency, using \ce{^{133}Ba}, \ce{^{137}Cs}, and \ce{^{152}Eu} sources at various distances from the front face of each detector. These efficiencies, along with gamma ray intensities for each transition, are used to convert the integrated counts in each gamma ray photopeak into an activity for the activated isotopes and isomeric states.

The foils were counted in their polyethylene holder, 10 cm from the front face of the 80\% HPGe and 1 cm from the front face of the LEPS, with the target foil (zinc or titanium) facing towards the front face of the detector when both target and monitor foils were counted simultaneously. All data collection was performed using the Ortec MAESTRO software. For each experiment the detector dead time was verified to be less than 5\%.  No summing corrections need to be made since all of the gammas are either non-coincident or formed in a back-to-back annihilation event. This was never an issue for any experiments, but had it been, the foils would be moved to a position of greater standoff from the detector.  

For the  \ce{^{47}Sc} production experiments, the foils were counted simultaneously using a planar LEPS detector. For the \ce{^{64}Cu} production experiments, the Indium foil was first counted separately using an 80\% HPGe detector, to capture the short-lived Indium activities. This is due to the fact that the \ce{^{115}In}(n,$\gamma$) reaction results in the production of \ce{^{116m}In} which has a 54 minute half-life and results in the production of 1097 keV (58.5\% branching), 1293 keV (84.8\% branching) and 2112 keV (15.09\% branching) gamma-rays that in turn produce a significant number of 511 keV gammas from pair-production followed by annihilation \cite{Blachot2010}. The foils were counted together again after approximately 4 hours of separate collection, to allow for nearly all of the \ce{^{116}In} to decay. Example spectra for each production pathway can be seen in \autoref{fig:spectra_a} and \autoref{fig:spectra_b}.

To verify that each peak corresponds to the assigned decay product, spectra were acquired in a sequence of 15 - 30 minute intervals. The resulting time series displayed in Figures \ref{fig:decay_curve_336} - \ref{fig:decay_curve_511} allow the fitting of exponential decay functions for each nuclide and comparison of the measured half-life with literature values. The fitted functions for each transition agree (at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level) with accepted half-lives \cite{Burrows2007,Singh2007,Blachot2010a,Blachot2012,Blachot2010}, confirming the respective peak assignments.

\subsection{Experimental verification of incident neutron energy}\label{sec:lee_sec}

As shown in \autoref{sec:sample_loading} above, the effective neutron energy depends on the angle range subtended by the sample with respect to the incident deuteron beam.  In order to determine this angle it is necessary to measure the lateral location of the beam with respect to the sample location.  This centroid of the beam was measured using a 3 x 3 array of 0.5 cm diameter indium foils.  The relative activity of these foils was then determined via post-irradiation counting of the \ce{^{115m}In} isomer ($t_{1/2}$ = 4.486 h) \cite{Blachot2012}.  \autoref{fig:in_heat_plot} below shows the measured activities for these 9 indium foils.  Based on these values we are able to verify that the beam was indeed centered on the middle of the zinc and titanium samples.

\subsection{Calculation of measured cross sections}\label{sec:calcs_sec}


For a thin target consisting of \(N_T\) target nuclei (with a reaction cross section $\sigma\pp{\bar{E}}$), subjected to a constant neutron flux $\phi\pp{\bar{E}}$, the rate of production ($R$) of the product nucleus will be:

\begin{equation}
R = N_T \sigma\pp{\bar{E}} \phi\pp{\bar{E}} 
\end{equation}

If this irradiation lasts for  some time $t_1$, and gamma ray spectrum acquisition begins at a later time $t_2$ and ends at  $t_3$, then the number of product decays ($D$; with decay constant $\lambda$) during the acquisition will be:



\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
D &= \dfrac{R}{\lambda}\pp{e^{\lambda t_1}-1}\pp{e^{-\lambda t_3} - e^{-\lambda t_2}}
\\
&= \dfrac{N_T \sigma\pp{\bar{E}} \phi\pp{\bar{E}} }{\lambda}\pp{e^{\lambda t_1}-1}\pp{e^{-\lambda t_3} - e^{-\lambda t_2}} 
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If this decay emits a gamma ray with branching ratio $I_\gamma$ (photons emitted per decay), and is detected with an absolute efficiency  of $\epsilon_\gamma$ (photons detected / photons emitted), then the number of observed decays between $t_2$ and $t_3$ will be:

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% N_{obs} &= D \epsilon_\gamma I_\gamma \\
% &= \? \epsilon_\gamma I_\gamma  \dfrac{N_T \sigma\pp{\bar{E}} \phi\pp{\bar{E}} }{\lambda}\pp{e^{\lambda t_1}-1}\pp{e^{-\lambda t_2} - e^{-\lambda t_3}} 
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

 

\begin{align}
N_{obs} &= D \epsilon_\gamma I_\gamma \\
&=  \epsilon_\gamma I_\gamma  \dfrac{N_T \sigma\pp{\bar{E}} \phi\pp{\bar{E}} }{\lambda}\pp{e^{\lambda t_1}-1}\pp{e^{-\lambda t_3} - e^{-\lambda t_2}} \nonumber
\end{align}

Solving this equation for the  cross section results in:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:single_xs_eqn}
\sigma\pp{\bar{E}} = \dfrac{N_{obs}\lambda}{N_T \epsilon_\gamma I_\gamma  \phi\pp{\bar{E}}  \pp{e^{\lambda t_1}-1}\pp{e^{-\lambda t_3} - e^{-\lambda t_2}}}
\end{equation}

\autoref{eqn:single_xs_eqn} can be used to determine the unknown (n,p) cross sections relative to the well-known \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In} and \ce{^{113}In}(n,n')\ce{^{113m}In} inelastic scattering cross sections since the Zn and Ti samples were co-irradiated with indium foils. This approach has a number of advantages since the result is independent of neutron flux and only depends on the relative detector efficiencies at each gamma-ray energy.  \autoref{eqn:calc_eqn} shows the ratio of the cross sections determined using this approach, in which subscript $P$ indicates a quantity for either \ce{^{64}Cu} or \ce{^{47}Sc}, and subscript $In$ indicates a quantity for either the \ce{^{113m}In} or \ce{^{115m}In} isomer. A minor term was added to correct for the small self-attenuation of the gamma rays emitted by the activated foils:



\begin{align}\label{eqn:calc_eqn}
\dfrac{\sigma_P}{\sigma_{In}} &=  \dfrac{A_P}{A_{In}} \dfrac{N_{T,In}}{N_{T,P}} \dfrac{\lambda_P}{\lambda_{In}} \dfrac{e^{\lambda_{In}t_1}-1}{e^{\lambda_{P}t_1}-1} \times \\
&\times \dfrac{e^{-\lambda_{In}t_3}-e^{-\lambda_{In}t_2}}{e^{-\lambda_{P}t_3} - e^{-\lambda_{P}t_2}} \dfrac{\epsilon_{In}}{\epsilon_P}  \dfrac{I_{\gamma,In}}{I_{\gamma,P}} \dfrac{e^{-\mu_{In}x_{In}/2}\times e^{-\mu_{In}x_{P}}}{e^{-\mu_{P}x_{P}/2}} \nonumber
\end{align}

where:

\begin{itemize}
  

\item $A$ is the integrated counts under a photopeak [counts],

\item $\sigma$ is the cross section for either the production of a product or isomer [mb],

\item $N_T$ is the initial number of target nuclei,

\item $\lambda$  is the decay constant [s$^{-1}$],

\item $t_1$ is the irradiation time [s],

\item $t_2$ is the time between the start-of-beam and the start of counting [s],

\item $t_3$ is the time  between the start-of-beam and the end of counting [s],

\item $\epsilon$ is the  detector efficiency for a particular photopeak,

\item $I_\gamma$ is the decay gamma ray branching ratio,

\item $\mu$ is the photon attenuation coefficient for a particular decay gamma ray in a foil [cm$^{-1}$],

\item and $x$ is the thickness of foil traversed by a particular decay gamma ray [cm] 
\end{itemize}

In addition to the \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In} reference cross section, the \ce{^{115}In}(n,$\gamma$)\ce{^{116m}In}  ($t_{1/2}$ = 54.29 min \cite{Blachot2010}) activity can be used to determine the  \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p) and \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p) cross section.  The capture activity is potentially subject to contamination from lower energy, especially thermal, \enquote{room return} neutrons since the (n,$\gamma$) cross section at 25 meV is approximately 2,000 times greater than at 2.7 MeV  \cite{Capote2012,zsolnay2012technical}.    

% \comment{cite relevant NDS article}



With the exception of decay constants, which have negligible uncertainty compared to other sources of uncertainties in this work, each of the parameters in this model carries a statistical uncertainty. Based on the assumption that these uncertainties are independent, the total relative statistical uncertainty $\delta_\sigma$ is calculated by taking the quadrature sum of the relative uncertainties of each parameter  $\delta_i$:

\begin{equation}
\delta_\sigma = \norm{ \ensuremath{\vec{\delta}} }_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^N  \delta_i^2  }
\end{equation}

This total statistical uncertainty will be plotted as the cross section error bar in the excitation function for these production reactions.



\subsection{Systematic errors}

The largest source of systematic uncertainty in the cross section determined via the \enquote{ratio approach} is the 2.586\% uncertainty in the \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In}  cross section and the 1.447\% uncertainty in the \ce{^{113}In}(n,n')\ce{^{113m}In}  cross section  \cite{Capote2012,zsolnay2012technical}.  An additional uncertainty arises from the fact that the Zn/Ti samples are not located at exactly the same location as the indium monitor foils, and are therefore not subject to precisely the same neutron flux.  However, the MCNP6 simulations shown in \autoref{fig:mcnp_flux} indicate that the difference in the flux that the two foils are subjected to is less than 2\%.  Other monitor foils could be used instead of indium, with \ce{^{57}Ni}(n,p)\ce{^{57}Co} being one possible candidate, but the 4.486 hour and 99.476 minute half-lives of the \ce{^{115m}In} and \ce{^{113m}In} isomers \cite{Blachot2012,Blachot2010a}, respectively, makes indium a better candidate for measuring the production of radionuclides with lifetimes much less than 77+ days. The largest source of uncertainty in energy window arises from uncertainties in the actual dimension of the deuteron beam on the production target.  We believe, based on \enquote{burn marks} on the production target that the beam was approximately circular, with a flat intensity profile and a 5 mm diameter.  However, every 1 mm change in the beam radius would cause a \textcolor{red}{XXX} MeV shift in the centroid and a \textcolor{red}{YYY} MeV change in the effective energy bin.

As mentioned above, the cross section can be obtained relative to both the inelastic scattering cross sections on \ce{^{113}In} and \ce{^{115}In}, and the capture of fast, unmoderated neutrons on \ce{^{115}In}.  The results from both are consistent, indicating that the contributions from thermal \enquote{room return} neutrons are negligible for samples mounted in the center of the HFNG.  This builds confidence in our results, and highlights the potential of using the HFNG for fast neutron capture reactions via activation.  This will be discussed in greater detail in the conclusion section below.  



\comment{The capture cross sections are actually consistent with effective 2.45 MeV neutrons (which are still fast). For capture of 2.76 MeV neutrons, we predict (n,p) cross sections approx. 15 mb less than using the In(n,n') monitors. How can we incorporate best this? Please suggest language changes / additions.}

          
\section{Conclusion}

Using activation methods on thin foils, the \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc} and \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} production cross sections were measured for  \textcolor{red}{2.7645 MeV +0.151/-0.219} neutrons produced using the High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG) at UC Berkeley. The cross sections were measured with a  5\% uncertainty relative to the well-known \ce{^{115}In}(n,n')\ce{^{115m}In} and \ce{^{113}In}(n,n')\ce{^{113m}In} fast neutron cross sections \cite{Capote2012,zsolnay2012technical}. The measured values of \textcolor{red}{XXXX and YYYY}, respectively, are consistent with earlier experimental data and theoretical models, but have smaller uncertainties than previous measurements. In addition, the results for the production of \ce{^{116}In} via the \ce{^{115}In}(n,$\gamma$) reaction was shown to be consistent with activation from the capture of fast (e.g., $\approx$2.45 MeV) neutrons, rather than from \enquote{room return} thermal neutrons. The use of DD neutron generators can be an efficient method for the measurement of low-energy (n,p) reaction channels, as well as a relative method used to normalize measurements at higher neutron energies. 

\comment{Truncate sig figs above, fill in values, use correct fast neutron energy above}


The proximity of the target to the neutron production surface also opens the possibility of performing a measurement of the cross section over a limited energy range via mounting the samples slightly off-axis with respect to the beam.  This could be accomplished using the 9-foil sample holder described in \autoref{sec:lee_sec} above.  Mounting samples at each of these positions would subject the samples to neutrons with energies ranging from \textcolor{red}{XXX at the central location to YYY} at the four corners, with the other locations having intermediate energy values.  These sorts of multi-sample measurements could be used to determine the \enquote{rising edge} of the cross sections, aiding in the development of optical models for the reactants.

\comment{fill in values above}


These measurements also highlight the possibility of using fast neutrons from DD and/or DT generators to produce meaningful quantities of radioisotopes for a wide range of applications via charge exchange reactions, such as (n,p) and (n,$\alpha$).  Many applications, including diagnostic and therapeutic medical use, require mCi activity levels.  The production of a radionuclide sample with an activity $A$ driven to secular equilibrium using a neutron source with a total flux $\phi$ and a reaction cross section $\sigma$ acting on sample of $N_{target}$ atoms is given by the expression:

\begin{equation}
A = \lambda N_{product} = \eta \phi \sigma N_{target}
\end{equation}

where we have introduced the dimensionless \emph{neutron utilization factor} $\eta$, which represents the likelihood of a neutron inducing the desired reaction on one of the target sample atoms:


% \begin{figure*}[H]
% \hline
% \begin{equation}
% \eta = \int_0^E dE_n \dfrac{\sigma_{(n,p)}}{\sigma_{(n,x)} + \sigma_{(n,p)}} \int N_{target} \pp{r,\theta,\phi} 4\pi r^2 dr d\pp{\cos{\theta}} d\theta
% \end{equation}
% \end{figure*}


% \begin{strip}

\begin{align}
\eta &= \int_0^E \text{d}E_n \dfrac{\sigma_{(n,p)}}{\sigma_{(n,x)} + \sigma_{(n,p)}} \int N_{target} \pp{r,\theta,\varphi} \text{d}\mathbf{V}, \nonumber\\
\text{d}\mathbf{V} &= r^2 \text{d}r \sin{\theta}\, \text{d}\theta\, \text{d}\varphi 
\end{align}
% \end{strip}


An optimal design for the neutron generator would also allow for the possibility of reflecting fast neutrons back onto the target to maximize their utilization for radionuclide production.  This sort of \enquote{flux trap} has been used for the production of radionuclides in reactors, but has not to date been optimized for use with fast neutrons  at DD and/or DT neutron sources.  The HFNG, with its self-loading target and \enquote{flux trap} geometry, has many features that make it well-suited for such isotope production purpose.  Switching to DT operation would dramatically increase the flux as well as the production cross section, since (n,p) tends to be significantly larger at 14 MeV.  However, the higher neutron energy would also open the (n,pn) channels.  In the case of \ce{^{47}Sc}, this would lead to the presence of \ce{^{46}Sc} ($t_{1/2}$ = 83.79 d \cite{Wu2000}) in the sample, which might pose some concerns for medical applications.  However, this is not an issue for \ce{^{64}Cu} since the (n,pn) channel leads to the production of stable \ce{^{63}Cu}.  


In closing, we have measured the \ce{^{64}Cu}(n,p) and \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p) cross sections at \textcolor{red}{2.7 MeV} incident neutron energies.  In addition to improving the value of these measurements nuclear reaction evaluation, our results highlight the potential use of compact neutron generators for the production of radionuclides locally for medical applications.  In the future we plan to perform additional cross section measurements at the HFNG, and to explore methods to extract the radionuclides from the sample using both chemical and physical separation techniques.  

\comment{fill in values above}


 Future work will involve the continued measurement of the (n,p) production cross sections for various other emerging therapeutic and diagnostic radioisotopes, to expand the toolset of options available for modern medical imaging and cancer therapy. This will focus on radionuclides which permit more customized and precise dose deposition, as well as patient-specific treatments
