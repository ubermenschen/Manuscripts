% The future of nuclear medicine would appear to be the paradigm of personalized medicine --- targeted radionuclide therapy to spare healthy tissue \cite{Mulford2005,Qaim201731}, and theranostic medicine, which pairs an imaging isotope with a therapeutic isotope (frequently, of the same element), to provide simultaneous, real-time dose delivery and verification, leading to drastic reductions in prescribed patient dose \cite{Muller2014,Bentzen2005,Srivastava2012}. 
% Other variants of theranostic medicine exist, including pre-imaging for treatment planning, or delivery of a single compound with different radioelements for imaging/therapy where the inter-element biodistribution has been validated.

Novel applications are being explored for several radionuclides whose production methodologies are not established, but their production requires accurate, high-fidelity cross section data.
% \cite{Qaim201731}. 
% Many of these applications focus on theranostics, the use of chemically identical (or similar) imaging and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for treatment of disease.

\section{\label{sec:experimental_fe}Experimental Methods and Materials}


The work described herein follows the  methods utilized in our recent work and established by Graves \etal\ 
% for the measurement of cross sections in stacked target irradiations   
for monitor reaction characterization of beam energy and fluence in stacked target irradiations \cite{Voyles2018,Graves2016}.
Preliminary analysis  was previously reported in the Master's thesis of one co-author, but the conclusive results of this work are described here  \cite{springer2017investigation}.

\subsection{\label{sec:target_design_fe}Stacked-target design}

\comment{Update these energies, post-analysis}

A pair of target stacks were constructed for this work, due to the large energy range desired to be spanned.
One stack covers the \textred{55--20}\,MeV range and the other covers \textred{25--5}\,MeV, to minimize the systematic uncertainties associated with degradation of beam energy.
In addition, the complementary  energy  of the  stacks helps build confidence  through multiple overlapping measurements between 20--25\,MeV.  
% A stacked-target design was utilized for this work in order that the (p,x) cross sections for each reaction channel could be measured at multiple energy positions in a single irradiation \cite{Cumming1963}. 
% For targets, a
A series of nominal 25\,\mmicro m \ce{^{nat}Fe} foils (99.5\%\cmmnt{, \textred{lot \#T23A035}}), 25\,\mmicro m \ce{^{nat}Ti} foils (99.6\%\cmmnt{, \textred{lot \#M06C032}}), and 25\,\mmicro m \ce{^{nat}Cu} foils (99.95\%\cmmnt{, \textred{lot \#N26B062}}) were used (all from Goodfellow Corporation, Coraopolis, PA 15108, USA) targets were used.
In each stack, seven foils of each metal were cut down to 2.5$\times$2.5\,cm squares and characterized --- for each foil, length and width measurements were taken at four different locations using a digital caliper (Mitutoyo America Corp.), thickness measurements were taken at four different locations using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo America Corp.), and four mass measurements were taken using an analytical balance after cleaning the foils with isopropyl alcohol.
Using these length, width, and mass readings, the areal density and its uncertainty (in mg/cm$^2$) for each foil was calculated.
% , along with the propagated uncertainty in areal density.
The foils were tightly sealed into \enquote{packets} using two pieces of  3M 1205-Series Kapton polyimide film tape --- each piece of tape consists of 38.1 \mmicro m of an acrylic adhesive (nominal 4.49 mg/cm$^2$) on 25.4 \mmicro m of a polyimide backing (nominal 3.61 mg/cm$^2$).
The sealed foils were mounted over the hollow center of a 1.5875 mm-thick aluminum frame.
Targets of 6061 aluminum alloy  serve as proton energy degraders  between energy positions.
% One \ce{^{nat}Al}, one \ce{^{nat}Cu}, and one \ce{^{nat}Nb} mounted foil were bundled together using baling wire for each energy position.
% These foil packet bundles were lowered into the beamline by inserting them into a  water-cooled production target box.
% These six foil packet bundles were inserted into one of six  
The target box, seen in \autoref{fig:fe_target_stack}, is machined from 6061 aluminum alloy, and mounts on the end of an electrically-isolated beamline.
% has a thin (0.64 mm) Inconel beam entrance window, and  contains 6 \enquote{energy positions} for targets, formed by  5 slabs of 6061 aluminum alloy (previously characterized) which serve as proton energy degraders  between energy positions.
% At both the front and rear of the target stack's foils, a 316 stainless steel foil is inserted to serve as a beam profile monitor --- after end-of-bombardment (EoB), decay radiation emitted from these activated stainless steel foils were used to develop radiochromic film (Gafchromic EBT3), revealing the spatial profile of the beam entering and exiting the stack.
% After loading all targets in the stack, the lid of the target box is sealed in place, using an inset o-ring to create a water-tight seal, and the box is lowered through a hot cell into the beamline, where it sits electrically isolated.
The specifications of both target stack designs for this work are presented in \autoref{tab:fe_stack_table}.

% \caption{Specifications of the  target stack design in the present work. The proton beam enters the stack upstream of the 249.8 \mmicro m SS profile monitor, and is transported through the stack in the order presented here. The 6061 aluminum degraders have a measured density of approximately 2.80 g/cm$^3$. Their areal densities were determined using the variance minimization techniques described  in this work  and the earlier paper by Graves \etal\ \cite{Graves2016}. At both the front and rear of the target stack's foils, a 316 stainless steel foil is inserted to serve as a beam profile monitor --- after end-of-bombardment (EoB), decay radiation emitted from these activated stainless steel foils were used to develop radiochromic film (Gafchromic EBT3), revealing the spatial profile of the beam entering and exiting the stack.}

\caption{Specifications of the 25\,MeV and 55\,MeV target stack designs in the present work. The proton beam enters the stack upstream of the SS-5 and SS-3 profile monitors, respectively, and is transported through the stack in the order presented here. The 6061 aluminum degraders have a measured density of approximately 2.69 g/cm$^3$. Their areal densities were determined using the variance minimization techniques described  in this work  and the earlier paper by Graves \etal\ \cite{Graves2016}. A 316 stainless steel foil is inserted at both the front and rear of each target stack as a monitor of the beam's spatial profile, by developing radiochromic film (Gafchromic EBT3) after end-of-bombardment (EoB).}

Both target stacks were assembled and separately irradiated at the  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory  (LBNL), using the 88-Inch Cyclotron, a  K=140 sector-focused cyclotron.
The 25\,MeV stack was irradiated for approximately 20\,minutes with a nominal current of 100\,nA,  for an anticipated integral current of 31.61\,nAh. 
The 55\,MeV stack was irradiated for approximately 10\,minutes with a nominal current of 120\,nA,  for an anticipated integral current of 20.78\,nAh. 
The beam current, measured using a current integrator on the electrically-isolated beamline, remained stable under these conditions for the duration of each irradiation.
The proton beam incident upon each stack's upstream stainless steel profile monitor had a maximum energy of either 25 or 55\,MeV, with an approximately 1.5\% energy width due to multi-turn extraction --- these energy profiles were used for all later analysis.
Following end-of-bombardment (EoB), each stack was removed from the beamline and disassembled.
All activated foils were transported to a counting lab for gamma spectrometry, which started approximately 30\,minutes following the end of each irradiation.

A single detector was used in this measurement, an ORTEC GMX Series (model \#GMX-50220-S)  High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) detector.
The detector is a nitrogen-cooled coaxial n-type HPGe with a 0.5\,mm beryllium window, and a 64.9\,mm diameter, 57.8\,mm long crystal.
Samples were counted at fixed positions ranging 5--60  cm (5\% maximum permissible dead-time) from the front face of the detector, with a series of standard calibration sources used to determine energy and efficiency for each position.
The foils were counted  for a period of 4 weeks following end-of-bombardment (EoB), to accurately quantify all induced activities.
% An example of one of the gamma-ray spectra collected in such a fashion is shown in \autoref{fig:gspec}.
For all spectra collected, net peak areas were fitted using the gamma spectrometry analysis code FitzPeaks \cite{fitzgerald2009fitzpeaks}, which utilizes the SAMPO fitting algorithms for gamma ray spectra \cite{Aarnio2001}.

% Following  acquisition, the decaying product nuclei corresponding to each observed peak in the collected spectra were identified.
The net  counts in each fitted gamma-ray photopeak were converted into  activities for the decaying  activation products, using calibrated detector efficiencies and gamma-ray intensities for each transition.
% and  corrections for gamma-ray attenuation within each foil packet
% The calibrated detector efficiencies, along with gamma-ray intensities for each transition and  corrections for gamma-ray attenuation within each foil packet, were used to convert the net  counts in each fitted gamma-ray photopeak into an activity for the decay of the activation products.  
The nuclear decay data used in this work is tabulated, for reference, in \autoref{tab:fe_nudat_table_monitors} and \autoref{tab:fe_nudat_table_nb} of Appendix \ref{sec:fe_data}.
Corrections for gamma-ray attenuation within each foil packet were made, using  photon attenuation coefficients from the XCOM photon cross sections database  \cite{berger2011xcom}.
% As nearly all of the product nuclei have multiple high-intensity gamma-rays, decay gamma-rays from the product nuclei were measured at multiple points in time (up to 2 weeks after EoB), as well as multiple independent activity measurements at each time point, based on each of its observed gamma-rays.

As in our previous work, these activities used to calculate cross sections, and are differentiated between cumulative and independent \cite{Voyles2018}.
For the first observable product nuclei in a mass chain, its (p,x) cross section will be reported as a cumulative cross section ($\sigma_c$), which is the sum of direct production of that nucleus, as well as decay of its  precursors and any other independent cross sections leading to that nucleus. 
% In addition, 
Cumulative cross sections will be reported whenever it is impossible to use decay spectrometry to distinguish independent production of a nucleus from decay feeding.
For all remaining observed reaction products in the mass chain, and cases where no decay precursors exist, independent cross sections ($\sigma_i$) will be reported, allowing for determination of the independent production via subtraction  and facilitating comparison to reaction model calculations.  
Solutions to the first- and higher-order  Bateman equations are used for separation of  feeding contributions from decay precursors, that  independent cross sections may be reported \cite{bateman1910solution,Cetnar2006}.





% Since many of the reaction products populated by energetic protons are more than one decay off of stability, many of these are produced not only  directly by reactions, but also indirectly by decay down a mass chain.
% To this end, it is useful to differentiate between the types of cross sections reported in this work. 
% For the first observable product nuclei in a mass chain, its (p,x) cross section will be reported as a cumulative cross section ($\sigma_c$), which is the sum of direct production of that nucleus, as well as decay of its  precursors and any other independent cross sections leading to that nucleus.

% % To convert these activities into cross sections, c
% Corrections must be made for the decay of the various reaction products during the time between EoB and the spectrum acquisition, in order to calculate $A_0$, the initial activity at EoB, from the measured activities.
% The use of  multiple gamma-rays at multiple points after EoB to calculate initial activities  for each observed product nucleus allows for a more accurate  determination of $A_0$ than simply basing its calculation off of a single gamma-ray observation.
% For the case of cumulative cross sections, EoB activities were quantified by fitting the activities observed at multiple time points $t$ (since EoB) to the well-known radioactive decay law.
% % \begin{equation}
% % A\pp{t} = A_0 e^{-\lambda t}
% % \end{equation}
% Nonlinear regression was used for this fitting process, minimizing on $\chi^2$\,/\,degree of freedom, so that not only would the uncertainty-weighted EoB activities be fitted, but that a 1-$\sigma$ confidence interval in $A_0$ could be reported as as well.
% As with the gamma-ray intensities, all lifetimes used in this work are tabulated in \autoref{tab:fe_nudat_table_monitors} and \autoref{tab:fe_nudat_table_nb} of \ref{sec:fe_data}.
% In the case of independent cross sections, a similar process was followed, quantifying $A_i\pp{t=0} = A_{i,0}$, the EoB activity of nuclide $i$, by instead regressing to the solutions to the Bateman equation \cite{bateman1910solution,Cetnar2006}:
% \begin{equation}
% A_n\pp{t} = \lambda_n \sum_{i=1}^n \left[  N_{i,0} \times \pp{\prod_{j=i}^{n-1}\lambda_j} \times \pp{\sum_{j=i}^n \dfrac{e^{-\lambda_j t}}{\prod_{i\neq j}^n \pp{\lambda_i - \lambda_j}}  }   \right]
% \end{equation}
% where $j$ refers to a precursor nucleus populating a specific end-product.  
% While higher-order terms were added if needed, typically for an isomeric state in a particular mass chain,  the second-order expansion ($n=2$) was often sufficient to quantify EoB activities in a mass chain, simplifying to:
% \begin{equation}
% A_2\pp{t} = \dfrac{A_{1,0}\lambda_2}{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2} \pp{e^{-\lambda_2 t} - e^{-\lambda_1 t}} + A_{2,0} e^{-\lambda_2 t}
% \end{equation}
% In these cases, the previously-quantified EoB activities from decay precursors ($A_{1,0}$, etc) would be substituted in, so that the feeding contributions from decay could be separated and an independent cross section reported.
% After quantifying the cumulative EoB activities at the top of a mass chain and all subsequent independent EoB activities, these will be later used to report the various cross sections for all observed reaction products and isomeric states.

% We present here a set of 38 measurements of cross sections for the \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) and  \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x) reactions between 40--90 MeV, as well as five independent measurements of isomer branching ratios.
% Nearly all cross sections have been reported with higher precision than previous measurements.
% We report the first measurements of the  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x)\ce{^{82m}Rb} reaction, as well as the first measurement of the independent cross sections for    \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{52\text{m}}Mn}, \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{52\text{g}}Mn}, and \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x)\ce{^{85\text{g}}Y} in the 40--90\,MeV region.
% We advise that future activation experiments avoid the use of silicone-based adhesives, particularly in conjunction with aluminum monitor foils, to avoid reporting an enhanced fluence due to \ce{^{22,24}Na} contamination.
% We also use these measurements to illustrate the deficiencies in the current state of  reaction modeling for 40--90\,MeV \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) and  \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x) reactions.
% Finally, this work provides another example of the usefulness of the recently-described variance minimization techniques for reducing energy uncertainties in stacked target charged particle irradiation experiments.



% 
% \paragraph{Syntax}
% The argument of \verb+\cite+ may be a single \emph{key}, 
% or may consist of a comma-separated list of keys.
% The citation \emph{key} may contain 
% letters, numbers, the dash (-) character, or the period (.) character. 
% New with natbib 8.3 is an extension to the syntax that allows for 
% a star (*) form and two optional arguments on the citation key itself.
% The syntax of the \verb+\cite+ command is thus (informally stated)
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+}+, or\\
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \emph{optarg+key} \verb+,+ \emph{optarg+key}\ldots \verb+}+,
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{optarg+key} signifies 
% \begin{quotation}\flushleft\leftskip1em
% \emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{*}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or\\
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}, or even\\
% \texttt{*}\texttt{[}\emph{pre}\texttt{]}\texttt{[}\emph{post}\texttt{]}\emph{key}.
% \end{quotation}\noindent
% where \emph{pre} and \emph{post} is whatever text you wish to place 
% at the beginning and end, respectively, of the bibliographic reference
% % (see Ref.~[\onlinecite{witten2001}] and the two under Ref.~[\onlinecite{feyn54}]).
% (Keep in mind that no automatic space or punctuation is applied.)
% It is highly recommended that you put the entire \emph{pre} or \emph{post} portion 
% within its own set of braces, for example: 
% \verb+\cite+ \verb+{+ \texttt{[} \verb+{+\emph{text}\verb+}+\texttt{]}\emph{key}\verb+}+.
% The extra set of braces will keep \LaTeX\ out of trouble if your \emph{text} contains the comma (,) character.
% 
% The star (*) modifier to the \emph{key} signifies that the reference is to be 
% merged with the previous reference into a single bibliographic entry, 
% % a common idiom in APS and AIP articles (see below, Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]). 
% When references are merged in this way, they are separated by a semicolon instead of 
% the period (full stop) that would otherwise appear.
% 
% \paragraph{Eliding repeated information}
% When a reference is merged, some of its fields may be elided: for example, 
% when the author matches that of the previous reference, it is omitted. 
% If both author and journal match, both are omitted.
% If the journal matches, but the author does not, the journal is replaced by \emph{ibid.},
% % as exemplified by Ref.~[\onlinecite{epr}]. 
% These rules embody common editorial practice in APS and AIP journals and will only
% be in effect if the markup features of the APS and AIP Bib\TeX\ styles is employed.
% 
% \paragraph{The options of the cite command itself}
% Please note that optional arguments to the \emph{key} change the reference in the bibliography, 
% not the citation in the body of the document. 
% For the latter, use the optional arguments of the \verb+\cite+ command itself:
% \verb+\cite+ \texttt{*}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{pre-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \texttt{[}\emph{post-cite}\texttt{]}\allowbreak
% \verb+{+\emph{key-list}\verb+}+.
