abstract = {In vitro and in vivo studies in human glioma models suggest that the antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 labeled with the 7.2-h–half-life $\alpha$-particle emitter 211At might be a valuable endoradiotherapeutic agent for the treatment of brain tumors. The purpose of this study was to develop methods for the production of high levels of 211At and the radiosynthesis of clinically useful amounts of 211At-labeled human/mouse chimeric 81C6 antibody. Methods: 211At was produced through the 209Bi($\alpha$, 2n)211At reaction using an internal target system and purified by a dry distillation process. Antibody labeling was accomplished by first synthesizing N-succinimidyl 3-[211At]astatobenzoate from the corresponding tri-n-butyl tin precursor and reacting it with the antibody in pH 8.5 borate buffer. Quality control procedures consisted of methanol precipitation, size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and pyrogen and sterility assays, as well as determination of the immunoreactive fraction by a rapid procedure using a recombinant tenascin fragment coupled to magnetic beads. Results: A total of 16 antibody labeling runs were performed. Using beam currents of 50–60 $\mu$A $\alpha$-particles and irradiation times of 1.5–4.5 h, the mean 211At production yield was 27.75 ± 2.59 MBq/$\mu$A.h, and the maximum level of 211At produced was 6.59 GBq after a 4-h irradiation at 55 $\mu$A. The decay-corrected distillation yield was 67% ± 16%. The yield for the coupling of the 211At-labeled active ester to the antibody was 76% ± 8%. The fraction of 211At activity that eluted with a retention time corresponding to intact IgG on HPLC was 96.0% ± 2.5%. All preparations had a pyrogen level of <0.125 EU/mL and were determined to be sterile. The mean immunoreactive fraction for these 16 preparations was 83.3% ± 5.3%. Radiolysis did not interfere with labeling chemistry or the quality of the labeled antibody product. Conclusion: These results show that it is feasible to produce clinically relevant activities of 211At-labeled antibodies and have permitted the initiation of a phase I trial of 211At-labeled chimeric 81C6 administered directly into the tumor resection cavities of brain tumor patients.},

abstract = {211At-labeled tumor-specific antibodies have long been considered for the treatment of disseminated cancer. However, the limited availability of the nuclide and the poor efficacy of labeling procedures at clinical activity levels present major obstacles to their use. This study evaluated a procedure for the direct astatination of antibodies for the production of clinical activity levels. Methods: The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was conjugated with the reagent N-succinimidyl-3-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate, and the immunoconjugate was labeled with astatine. Before astatination of the conjugated antibody, the nuclide was activated with N-iodosuccinimide. The labeling reaction was evaluated in terms of reaction time, volume of reaction solvent, immunoconjugate concentration, and applied activity. The quality of the astatinated antibodies was determined by in vitro analysis and biodistribution studies in nude mice. Results: The reaction proceeded almost instantaneously, and the results indicated a low dependence on immunoconjugate concentration and applied activity. Radiochemical labeling yields were in the range of 68%−81%, and a specific radioactivity of up to 1 GBq/mg could be achieved. Stability and radiochemical purity were equal to or better than those attained with a conventional 2-step procedure. Dissociation constants for directly astatinated, conventionally astatinated, and radioiodinated trastuzumab were 1.0 ± 0.06 (mean ± SD), 0.44 ± 0.06, and 0.29 ± 0.02 nM, respectively. The tissue distribution in non–tumor-bearing nude mice revealed only minor differences in organ uptake relative to that obtained with the conventional method. Conclusion: The direct astatination procedure enables the high-yield production of astatinated antibodies with radioactivity in the amounts required for clinical applications.},

abstract = {We have improved a pneumatic sample transport system that enables activation cross-sections to be measured by producing short-lived nuclei on the order of sub-millibarns. The irradiation distances between the d-D neutron source and the samples ranged from 20 to 65 mm at six angles of between 0° and 155°. The neutron fluence rates were between 1×108 and 5×106 n/cm2/s in the 2.1–3.1 MeV range, and these values were between 24 and 3 times higher than those of the previous system, which used a distance of 100 mm, at the Fusion Neutronics Source at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. The energy spreads at the irradiation positions were calculated by taking into account the slowing of incident 350-keV deuterons, the self-loaded deuteron distribution in the Ti-target and the solid angle subtended by the irradiated sample. At each angle, the acceptable close distance was found to be about 20 mm under the condition of an energy spread of less than about 300 keV. The spreads at about 0° and 180° were determined mainly by the slowing of deuterons in the target, while those at about 90° were determined by the finite solid angle. The activation cross-sections of 27Al (n, p) 27Mg and 61Ni (n, p) 61Co reactions were obtained for test measurements. This was undertaken with the prospect of using the present system to systematically measure the activation cross-sections down to a sub-millibarn level.},

abstract = {This account briefly traces the growth of our theoretical and experimental knowledge of electron–positron pair production by photons, from the prediction of the positron by Dirac [1928a. The quantum theory of the electron. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 117, 610–624; 1928b. The quantum theory of the electron. Part II. Proc. R. Soc. (London) A 118, 1928b, 351–361] and subsequent cloud-chamber observations by Anderson [Energies of cosmic-ray particles. Phys. Rev. 43, 491–494], up to the present time. Photons of energies above 2mec2 (1.022 MeV) can interact with the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus to be transformed into an electron–positron pair, the probability increasing with increasing photon energy, up to a plateau at high energies, and increasing with increasing atomic number approximately as the square of the nuclear charge (proton number). This interaction can also take place in the field of an atomic electron, for photons of energy in excess of 4mec2 (2.044 MeV), in which case the process is called triplet production due to the track of the recoiling atomic electron adding to the tracks of the created electron–positron pair. The last systematic computations and tabulations of pair and triplet cross sections, which are the predominant contributions to the photon mass attenuation coefficient for photon energies 10 MeV and higher, were those of Hubbell et al. [Pair, triplet, and total atomic cross sections (and mass attenuation coefficients) for 1 MeV–100 GeV photons in elements Z=1–100. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data 9, 1023–1147], from threshold (1.022 MeV) up to 100 GeV, for all elements Z = 1 –100. These computations required some ad hoc bridging functions between the available low-energy and high-energy theoretical models. Recently (1979–2001), Sud and collaborators have developed some new approaches including using distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) theory to compute pair production cross sections in the intermediate energy region (5.0–10.0 MeV) on a firmer theoretical basis. These and other recent developments, and their possible implications for improved computations of pair and triplet cross sections, are discussed.},

abstract = {The evaluated experimental data are presented for 14 known nuclides of mass 87 (Ga, Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru). New datasets have been added for 87Ga, 87Se, 87Kr, 87Rb, 87Sr, 87Nb, and 87Tc. The observation of and new lifetime measurements for 87As at the NSCL Coupled Cyclotron Facility and the Oak Ridge Isochronous Cyclotron at the HRIBF-ORNL Facility are included in the adopted levels for this isotope. The new evaluation also includes an isomeric level at unknown energy for 87Tc, changes to the adopted levels for 87Nb based on newly published data including an extension of the high spin levels and new lifetime measurements, and new heavy ion data for 87Kr. New high spin levels for 87Rb were observed, indicating possible neutron core excitations. In addition, the ground state lifetime of 87Rb has been revised and a new lifetime measurement for an excited level in 87Rb indicates a possible proton spin flip. New excitation levels have been observed for the first time in 87Se. New direct and precise measurement of atomic masses of 87Tc, 87Mo, 87Nb, 87Zr, 87Mo and 87Tc have greatly improved the Q value landscape in this mass region. This work supersedes the previous A=87 evaluation published in 2002He09, and Q values for all isotopes were updated to incorporate the mass evaluation in 2012Wa38.},

abstract = {In the density matrix formalism, the ensemble of atoms or ions is expressed in terms of population and alignment of excited levels and the ground state. The population of an excited level determines the intensity of an emission line originating from this level and the alignment gives rise to the linear polarization of this line. Spatially anisotropic collisions induce transitions between the populations and the alignments; for example, an alignment along with a population is produced by a beam of electrons in an excited level from the ground-state population. Thus, an anisotropic plasma produces polarized radiations, and by plasma polarization spectroscopy (PPS) we can investigate the anisotropic, and thus non-thermal, features of the plasma. The angular distribution of the perturber velocities is expanded in terms of Legendre polynomials. The expansion coefficients and the relevant cross sections for the transitions among the populations and the alignments yield the rate coefficients for these transitions. For the ensemble of atoms or ions immersed in the plasma, coupled rate equations are constructed for the populations and the alignments of excited levels. We review the present status of our knowledge of the collision cross sections for various collision processes. Several experimental observations of PPS performed so far are reviewed, which include those on a tokamak plasma, laser produced plasmas, various discharge plasmas and solar flares. We discuss what kind of information could be obtained from PPS.},

abstract = {Production of radioactive scandium by irradiating natural titanium metal in Pakistan Research Reactor-1 was evaluated. The production rate of 47Sc and other radioactive scandium was estimated. High specific activity 47Sc can be produced by irradiating enriched 47Ti in sufficient quantities needed for therapeutic applications. A new separation technique based on column chromatography was developed. Neutron irradiated titanium was dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, which was evaporated and taken in distilled water. The resulting solution was loaded on silica gel column. The radioactive scandium comes out first and the inactive titanium is removed with 2 M HCl. More than 95{%} radioactive scandium was recovered, while chemical impurity of titanium determined by optical emission spectroscopy was less than 0.01 $\mu$g/mL in final product.},

abstract = {Differences in the pattern of organization of organisms may lead to different patterns of evolution, genetics and ecology, Plants and animals differ in their fundamental patterns of organization. Plants consist of a series of repeating units that compete with one another, while animals consist of mutually interdependent systems that cannot compete. As a result, plants may be able to take advantage of somatic mutations in ways that are not available to animals. Somatic mutations arising in plants can be inherited by naturally occurring mechanisms of sexual and asexual reproduction. Long life span, large clone size, and the complete regeneration of buds each year may permit an indivdual plant or clone to evolve. Plants may even develop as mosaics of genetic variation. Evolution by individual plants and/or development as mosaics of genetic variation may prevent herbivores from breaking the defenses of their host plants. This evolution may also result in greater “fine tuning” to local environments leading to ecotypic variation.},

abstract = {Experimental nuclear spectroscopic data for known nuclides of mass number 62 (Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge) have been evaluated and presented together with adopted properties of levels and $\gamma$ rays. New high-spin data are available for 62Ga, and 62Zn. Results of in-beam $\gamma$-ray studies for 62Cu producing high-spin states are in conflict in terms of gamma-ray placements and branching ratios. In the opinion of the evaluators, a detailed study of high-spin structures in 62Cu is needed to obtain a consistent and confident level scheme. Precise studies of superallowed $\beta$ decay of 62Ga to 62Zn by several groups have extended the decay scheme. No significant new data, since the 2000 NDS for A = 62 (2000Hu18), have been reported for 62Co, 62Ni and 62Cu. No data are yet available for excited states in 62Ti and 62V, and those for 62Cr and 62Ge are scarce. The level lifetime data are available in very few cases. The radioactive decay schemes of 62Ti and 62Ge are unknown, and those for 62V, 62Cr and 92-ms 62Mn are scantily known. The data presented here supersede those in the earlier NDS publications.},

The default ICC table, based on the Dirac-Fock calculations using the so called "Frozen Orbital" approximation, takes into account the effect of atomic vacancies created in the conversion process. The table has been calculated for all atomic shells and to cover transition energies of 1-6000 keV and atomic numbers of Z = 5-110.

abstract = {In recent years, 47Sc has attracted attention because of its favorable decay characteristics (half-life, 3.35 d; average energy, 162 keV; E$\gamma$, 159 keV) for therapeutic application and for SPECT imaging. The aim of the present study was to investigate the suitability of 47Sc for radionuclide therapy in a preclinical setting. For this purpose a novel DOTA-folate conjugate (cm10) with an albumin-binding entity was used. Methods: 47Sc was produced via the 46Ca(n,$\gamma$)47Ca47Sc nuclear reaction at the high-flux reactor at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Separation of the 47Sc from the target material was performed by a semi-automated process using extraction chromatography and cation exchange chromatography. 47Sc-labeled cm10 was tested on folate receptor–positive KB tumor cells in vitro. Biodistribution and SPECT imaging experiments were performed in KB tumor–bearing mice. Radionuclide therapy was conducted with two groups of mice, which received either 47Sc-cm10 (10 MBq) or only saline. Tumor growth and survival time were compared between the two groups of mice. Results: Irradiation of 46Ca resulted in approximately 1.8 GBq of 47Ca, which subsequently decayed to 47Sc. Separation of 47Sc from 47Ca was obtained with 80% yield in only 10 min. The 47Sc was then available in a small volume (∼500 $\mu$L) of an ammonium acetate/HCl (pH 4.5) solution suitable for direct radiolabeling. 47Sc-cm10 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of more than 96% at a specific activity of up to 13 MBq/nmol. In vitro 47Sc-cm10 showed folate receptor–specific binding and uptake into KB tumor cells. In vivo SPECT/CT images allowed the visualization of accumulated radioactivity in KB tumors and in the kidneys. The therapy study showed a significantly delayed tumor growth in mice, which received 47Sc-cm10 (10 MBq, 10 Gy) resulting in a more than 50% increase in survival time, compared with untreated control mice. Conclusion: With this study, we demonstrated the suitability of using 47Sc for therapeutic purposes. On the basis of our recent results obtained with 44Sc-folate, the present work confirms the applicability of 44Sc/47Sc as an excellent matched pair of nuclides for PET imaging and radionuclide therapy.},

abstract = {This study develops techno-economic models for assessment of the conversion of biomass to valuable fuel products via fast pyrolysis and bio-oil upgrading. The upgrading process produces a mixture of naphtha-range (gasoline blend stock) and diesel-range (diesel blend stock) products. This study analyzes the economics of two scenarios: onsite hydrogen production by reforming bio-oil, and hydrogen purchase from an outside source. The study results for an nth plant indicate that petroleum fractions in the naphtha distillation range and in the diesel distillation range are produced from corn stover at a product value of $3.09/gal ($0.82/liter) with onsite hydrogen production or $2.11/gal ($0.56/liter) with hydrogen purchase. These values correspond to a $0.83/gal ($0.21/liter) cost to produce the bio-oil. Based on these nth plant numbers, product value for a pioneer hydrogen-producing plant is about $6.55/gal ($1.73/liter) and for a pioneer hydrogen-purchasing plant is about $3.41/ gal ($0.92/liter). Sensitivity analysis identifies fuel yield as a key variable for the hydrogen-production scenario. Biomass cost is important for both scenarios. Changing feedstock cost from $50–$100 per short ton changes the price of fuel in the hydrogen production scenario from $2.57–$3.62/gal ($0.68–$0.96/liter).},

abstract = {The January 2012 arrest of Canadian Sub-Lieutenant Jeffery Delisle for supplying Top Secret intelligence to Russia reminded Canadians of Canada's involvement in the Five Eyes intelligence community, the world's most exclusive intelligence sharing club that includes Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. This paper promotes further understanding of the nature and structure of the Five Eyes intelligence community by reviewing three selected intelligence disciplines—signals intelligence (sigint), national assessment, and defence intelligence. The Five Eyes intelligence community grew out of twentieth-century British-American intelligence cooperation. While not monolithic; the group is more cohesive than generally known. Rather than being centrally choreographed, the Five Eyes group is more of a cooperative, complex network of linked autonomous intelligence agencies, interacting with an affinity strengthened by a profound sense of confidence in each other and a degree of professional trust so strong as to be unique in the world. The paper suggests that, given Canadian foreign policy initiatives and evolving strategic security threats, not only must Canada maintain credible and valuable intelligence support to its partners, the Five Eyes intelligence community as a whole must remain integrated, effective and dominant},

abstract = {Transgenic plants are promising alternatives for the low-cost and safe pathogen-free production of complex recombinant pharmaceutical proteins (molecular farming). Plants as higher eukaryotes perform posttranslational modifications similar to those of mammalian cells. However, plant-specific protein N -glycosylation was shown to be immunogenic, a fact that represents a drawback for many plant systems in biopharmaceutical production. The moss Physcomitrella patens offers unique properties as a contained system for protein production. It is grown in the predominant haploid gametophytic stage as tissue suspension cultures in photobioreactors. Efficient secretory signals and a transient transfection system allow the secretion of freshly synthesized proteins to the surrounding medium. The key advantage of Physcomitrella compared to other plant systems is the feasibility of targeted gene replacements. By this means, moss strains with non-immunogenic humanized glycan patterns were created. Here we present an overview of the relevant aspects for establishing moss as a production system for recombinant biopharmaceuticals.},

abstract = {AbstractPurpose: We investigated the effect of incorporation of a nuclear localization signal (NLS) into a conjugate comprising the DNA binding ligand para-iodoHoechst (PIH) and octreotate on its DNA binding and affinity to the somatostatin receptor (SSTR). Confirmation of these properties would support development of similar conjugates labelled with Auger emitters for their potential in Auger endoradiotherapy. Materials and methods: We synthesized conjugates of PIH and octreotate (PO) or PIH and NLS (PN) and a conjugate comprising PIH, NLS and octreotate (PNO). DNA-binding characteristics of PIH and conjugates were assessed using synthetic DNA oligonucleotides employing spectrophotometric titration of ligand solutions with DNA. We used membranes from the type 2 SSTR (SSTR2) overexpressing human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A427-7 to investigate the binding affinity of PNO. Results: We demonstrated PN and PNO retain specific high affinity DNA-binding properties observed for PIH, and acquire an additional non-specific binding capacity. No DNA binding was observed for PO. PNO retains its binding affinity for SSTR. Conclusions: The DNA-binding properties of PNO and its affinity for SSTR suggests that it could potentially be used for tumour-specific delivery of PIH labelled with an Auger emitter in SSTR expressing tumours.},

abstract = {Experimental angular distributions from (d, p) and (d, n) nuclear reactions involve contributions from incident angular momenta much higher than is compatible with compound nucleus formation, and indicate that these reactions must proceed to a large extent by means of a stripping process. The angular distributions to be expected from a stripping process are calculated, and these are found to be very sensitive to the angular momenta which can be accepted by the initial nucleus, i.e. to the spins and parities of the energy levels involved. In any one case there is found excellent agreement between the experimental curve and just one of the possible theoretical curves, and if the spin and parity of the ground state of the initial nucleus is known, this allows of a determination of the spin and parity of the appropriate level of the final nucleus. In this way it is found, for example, that the ground state of $^{17}$O has spin $\frac{5}{2}$ or $\frac{3}{2}$ and even parity, and that the first excited state of $^{17}$O (0$\cdot $88 MeV above ground) has spin $\frac{1}{2}$ and even parity. Determinations are also made of the spins and parities of the ground states and several excited states of $^{13}$C, $^{15}$N and $^{28}$Al. Families of theoretical curves for a variety of incident and outgoing energies are presented in order to facilitate further spin and parity determinations from future experimental results.},

abstract = {Biodiesel, defined as monoalkyl fatty acid ester (preferentially methyl and ethyl esters), represents a promising alternative fuel for use in compression-ignition (diesel) engines. Biodiesel fuel comes from renewable sources as it is plant- not petroleum-derived and as such it is biodegradable and less toxic. In addition, relative to conventional diesel, its combustion products have reduced levels of particulates, carbon oxides, sulphur oxides and, under some conditions, nitrogen oxides. Enzymatic production of biodiesel has been proposed to overcome the drawbacks of the conventional chemically catalyzed processes. The main obstacle facing full exploitation of the enzyme, lipase, potential is its cost. Therefore, reuse of lipase is essential from the economic point of view, which can be achieved by using the lipase in immobilized form. In addition, immobilized lipase displays improved stability and activity. Common immobilization techniques include attachment to solid supports and entrapment within the matrix of a polymer. This article presents a comparison between conventional processes and enzymatic processes and different possible feedstocks for biodiesel production. In addition, possible ways to overcome the problems facing the use of lipase are described. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd},

abstract = {Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are two identifying biomarkers expressed in very high numbers on prostate cancer cells and could serve as a useful tool for molecular targeting and diagnosis of disease via positron-emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to produce the multipurpose, bivalent [DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] radioligand for prostate cancer imaging, where DUPA=(2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido]pentanedioic acid), a small-molecule, PSMA-targeting probe, 6Ahx=6-aminohexanoic acid, 5-Ava=5-aminovaleric acid, NODAGA=[2-(4,7-biscarboxymethyl)-1,4,7-(triazonan-1-yl)pentanedioic acid] (a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)), and BBN(7-14)NH2=bombesin, a GRPr-specific peptide targeting probe. Methods: The PSMA/GRPr dual targeting ligand precursor [DUPA-6-Ahx-K-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2], was synthesized by solid-phase and manual peptide synthesis, after which NODAGA was added via manual conjugation to the ??-amine of lysine (K). The new bivalent GRPr/PSMA targeting vector was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), characterized by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and metallated with 64CuCl2 and natCuCl2. The receptor binding affinity was evaluated in human, prostate, PC-3 (GRPr-positive) and LNCaP (PSMA-positive) cells and the tumor-targeting efficacy determined in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and athymic nude mice bearing PC-3 and LNCaP tumors. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were obtained 18h post-injection (p.i.). Results: Competitive binding assays in PC-3 and LNCaP cells indicated high receptor binding affinity for the [DUPA-6-Ahx-(natCu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] conjugate. MicroPET scintigraphy in PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice indicated that xenografted tumors were visible at 18h p.i. with collateral, background radiation also being observed in non-target tissue. Conclusions: DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] targeting vector, as described herein, is the first example of a dual GRPr-/PSMA-targeting radioligand for molecular of imaging prostate tumors. Detailed in vitro studies and microPET molecular imaging investigations of [DUPA-6-Ahx-(64Cu-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2 in tumor-bearing mice indicate that further studies are necessary to optimize uptake and retention of tracer in GRPr- and PSMA-positive tissues. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {Background and purpose CLR1404 is a phospholipid ether that exhibits selective uptake and retention in malignant tissues. Radiolabeled CLR1404 enables tumor-specific positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging (124I) and targeted delivery of ionizing radiation (131I). Here we describe the first preclinical studies of this diapeutic molecule in head and neck cancer (HNC) models. Material and methods Tumor-selective distribution of 124I-CLR1404 and therapeutic efficacy of 131I-CLR1404 were tested in HNC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft tumor models. Monte Carlo dose calculations and 124I-CLR1404 PET/CT imaging were used to examine 131I-CLR1404 dosimetry in preclinical HNC tumor models. Results HNC tumor xenograft studies including patient-derived xenografts demonstrate tumor-selective uptake and retention of 124I-CLR1404 resulting in a model of highly conformal dose distribution for 131I-CLR1404. We observe dose-dependent response to 131I-CLR1404 with respect to HNC tumor xenograft growth inhibition and this effect is maintained together with external beam radiation. Conclusions We confirm the utility of CLR1404 for tumor imaging and treatment of HNC. This promising agent warrants further investigation in a developing phase I trial combining 131I-CLR1404 with reduced-dose external beam radiation in patients with loco-regionally recurrent HNC.},

I will compare and contrast between them by developing a typology of major ideologies of active Islamic trends that centers specifically on Wahhabism and neo-Wahhabism, salafism and neo- salafism, and Islamism, both moderate and radical. Understanding these trends and their discourses will allow world powers, policymakers, academicians, intellectuals, terrorism experts, journalists, and many others to distinguish between and understand the logic of the radical and the moderate, the active and the inactive, the jihadi and the peaceful, the takfiri and the tolerant, the modern and the traditional, and the rational and irrational.

abstract = { ▪ Abstract The size and frequency of meals are fundamental aspects of nutrition that can have profound effects on the health and longevity of laboratory animals. In humans, excessive energy intake is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers and is a major cause of disability and death in industrialized countries. On the other hand, the influence of meal frequency on human health and longevity is unclear. Both caloric (energy) restriction (CR) and reduced meal frequency/intermittent fasting can suppress the development of various diseases and can increase life span in rodents by mechanisms involving reduced oxidative damage and increased stress resistance. Many of the beneficial effects of CR and fasting appear to be mediated by the nervous system. For example, intermittent fasting results in increased production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which increases the resistance of neurons in the brain to dysfunction and degeneration in animal models of neurodegenerative disorders; BDNF signaling may also mediate beneficial effects of intermittent fasting on glucose regulation and cardiovascular function. A better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms by which meal size and frequency affect human health may lead to novel approaches for disease prevention and treatment. },

abstract = {Throughout human history, natural products have been the foundation for the discovery and development of therapeutics used to treat diseases ranging from cardiovascular disease to cancer. Their chemical diversity and complexity have provided structural scaffolds for small-molecule drugs and have consistently served as inspiration for medicinal design. However, the chemical complexity of natural products also presents one of the main roadblocks for production of these pharmaceuticals on an industrial scale. Chemical synthesis of natural products is often difficult and expensive, and isolation from their natural sources is also typically low yielding. Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering offer an alternative approach that is becoming more accessible as the tools for engineering microbes are further developed. By reconstructing heterologous metabolic pathways in genetically tractable host organisms, complex natural products can be produced from inexpensive sugar starting materials through large-scale fermentation processes. In this Perspective, we discuss ongoing research aimed toward the production of terpenoid natural products in genetically engineered Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

@article{Grogan201362,
abstract = {Abstract The detonation of a terrorist nuclear weapon in the United States would result in the massive loss of life and grave economic damage. Even if a device was not detonated, its known or suspected presence aboard a cargo container ship in a U.S. port would have major economic and political consequences. One possible means to prevent this threat would be to board a ship at sea and search for the device before it reaches port. The scenario considered here involves a small Coast Guard team with strong intelligence boarding a container ship to search for a nuclear device. Using active interrogation, the team would nonintrusively search a block of shipping containers to locate the fissile material. Potential interrogation source and detector technologies for the team are discussed. The methodology of the scan is presented along with a technique for calculating the required interrogation source strength using computer simulations. {MCNPX} was used to construct a computer model of a container ship, and several search scenarios were simulated. The results of the simulations are presented in terms of the source strength required for each interrogation scenario. Validation measurements were performed in order to scale these simulation results to expected performance. Interrogations through the short (2.4&#xa0;m) axis of a standardized shipping container appear to be feasible given the entire range of container loadings tested. Interrogations through several containers at once or a single container through its long (12.2&#xa0;m) axis do not appear to be viable with a portable interrogation system. },

abstract = {An attractive feature of targeted radionuclide therapy is the ability to select radionuclides and targeting vehicles with characteristics that are best suited for a particular clinical application. One combination that has been receiving increasing attention is the use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically reactive to receptors and antigens that are expressed in tumor cells to selectively deliver the ??-particle-emitting radiohalogen astatine-211 (211At) to malignant cell populations. Promising results have been obtained in preclinical models with multiple 211At-labeled mAbs; however, translation of the concept to the clinic has been slow. Impediments to this process include limited radionuclide availability, the need for suitable radiochemistry methods operant at high activity levels and lack of data concerning the toxicity of ??-particle emitters in humans. Nonetheless, two clinical trials have been initiated to date with 211At-labeled mAbs, and others are planned for the near future. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Little is known of the biochemistry of diatoms, although many workers have reported growth experiments with the unicellular algae of the marine phyto-plankton. Experiments have often been performed without due regard for the appropriate control of physical and chemical conditions. Many reports contain only incomplete data of the growth under a given set of conditions, and it is often impossible to say whether the effects recorded are upon the growth rate, the total crop, or both. Other studies have been reported which included the addition of organic matter to cultures which were only uni-algal and not bacteria-free. At the present time even the mere maintenance of stock cultures of the marine unicellular algae is perforce an empirical matter. Results in replicate cultures often show gross differences in growth that are apparent on inspection by eye alone, and insufficient information is available regarding the nature of these variations in growth to allow the rational development of improved culture media. Due therefore to a lack of suitable techniques, most of the results available are difficult, if not impossible, to interpret in terms of the biochemical activities of the algae.},

abstract = {We present the first x-ray spectroscopic measurements of the ionization balance relevant to astrophysics with intense laser. Independent measurement of the radiation flux indicates values of the ionization parameter $\xi$ $\sim$ 10 erg cm s -1 and Planckian radiation source of 80 eV to photoionize the nitrogen gas. The observed emission spectra of nitrogen of relatively low density ( n i = 1.4 × 10 19 cm −3 ) shows a good agreement with the synthetic spectra by a time-dependent DCA (Detailed Configuration Accounting) atomic model. In this model, it solves the rate equations for level population distributions by considering collisional and radiative atomic processes based on screened hydrogenic model. The jj configuration atomic states and transition probabilities are calculated with Hullac to synthesize spectrum. With this model, we can obtain a reasonable range of the electron temperatures of 20 — 30 eV. Comparisons of charge-state distribution with a non-LTE atomic model FLYCHK show reasonable agreement.},

The overarching process design converts corn stover to ethanol by dilute-acid pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, and co-fermentation. Building on design reports published in 2002 and 1999, NREL, together with the subcontractor Harris Group Inc., performed a complete review of the process design and economic model for the biomass-to-ethanol process. This update reflects NREL's current vision of the biochemical ethanol process and includes the latest research in the conversion areas (pretreatment, conditioning, saccharification, and fermentation), optimizations in product recovery, and our latest understanding of the ethanol plant's back end (wastewater and utilities). The conceptual design presented here reports ethanol production economics as determined by 2012 conversion targets and 'nth-plant' project costs and financing. For the biorefinery described here, processing 2,205 dry ton/day at 76% theoretical ethanol yield (79 gal/dry ton), the ethanol selling price is $2.15/gal in 2007$.},

The thermolysis is carried out in a single fluidized bed of inert material operating at near atmospheric pressure, relatively low temperature, long solids and gas residence times and moderate heating rates. The distribution of the thermolysis products among, solid (char) and gases under these conditions is unique. The product effluent can be either quenched to produce a high liquid yield in addition to a low char yield or the volatile effluent can be used in either the same combustor or a second combustor to produce heat energy a particularly high efficiency system. In using a quencher, the quenched liquid is of similar composition to those obtained by so called fast pyrolysis processes of the prior art. The specified conditions are such as to allow production of liquids in high yields in an energy efficient manner. The low severity of the conditions in comparison with previous approaches allows simplified process design and scale-up leading to lower capital and operating costs as well as easier control.},

abstract = {We describe the next generation general purpose Evaluated Nuclear Data File, ENDF/B-VII.0, of recommended nuclear data for advanced nuclear science and technology applications. The library, released by the U.S. Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in December 2006, contains data primarily for reactions with incident neutrons, protons, and photons on almost 400 isotopes, based on experimental data and theory predictions. The principal advances over the previous ENDF/B-VI library are the following: (1) New cross sections for U, Pu, Th, Np and Am actinide isotopes, with improved performance in integral validation criticality and neutron transmission benchmark tests; (2) More precise standard cross sections for neutron reactions on H, 6Li, 10B, Au and for 235,238U fission, developed by a collaboration with the {IAEA} and the OECD/NEA Working Party on Evaluation Cooperation (WPEC); (3) Improved thermal neutron scattering; (4) An extensive set of neutron cross sections on fission products developed through a {WPEC} collaboration; (5) A large suite of photonuclear reactions; (6) Extension of many neutron- and proton-induced evaluations up to 150 MeV; (7) Many new light nucleus neutron and proton reactions; (8) Post-fission beta-delayed photon decay spectra; (9) New radioactive decay data; (10) New methods for uncertainties and covariances, together with covariance evaluations for some sample cases; and (11) New actinide fission energy deposition. The paper provides an overview of this library, consisting of 14 sublibraries in the same ENDF-6 format as the earlier ENDF/B-VI library. We describe each of the 14 sublibraries, focusing on neutron reactions. Extensive validation, using radiation transport codes to simulate measured critical assemblies, show major improvements: (a) The long-standing underprediction of low enriched uranium thermal assemblies is removed; (b) The 238U and 208Pb reflector biases in fast systems are largely removed; (c) ENDF/B-VI.8 good agreement for simulations of thermal high-enriched uranium assemblies is preserved; (d) The underprediction of fast criticality of 233,235U and 239Pu assemblies is removed; and (e) The intermediate spectrum critical assemblies are predicted more accurately. We anticipate that the new library will play an important role in nuclear technology applications, including transport simulations supporting national security, nonproliferation, advanced reactor and fuel cycle concepts, criticality safety, fusion, medicine, space applications, nuclear astrophysics, and nuclear physics facility design. The ENDF/B-VII.0 library is archived at the National Nuclear Data Center, BNL, and can be retrieved from www.nndc.bnl.gov.},

abstract = {FLYCHK is a straightforward, rapid tool to provide ionization and population distributions of plasmas in zero dimension with accuracy sufficient for most initial estimates and in many cases is applicable for more sophisticated analysis. FLYCHK solves rate equations for level population distributions by considering collisional and radiative atomic processes. The code is designed to be straightforward to use and yet is general enough to apply for most laboratory plasmas. Further, it can be applied for low-to-high Z ions and in either steady-state or time-dependent situations. Plasmas with arbitrary electron energy distributions, single or multiple electron temperatures can be studied as well as radiation-driven plasmas. To achieve this versatility and accuracy in a code that provides rapid response we employ schematic atomic structures, scaled hydrogenic cross-sections and read-in tables. It also employs the jj configuration averaged atomic states and oscillator strengths calculated using the Dirac–Hartree–Slater model for spectrum synthesis. Numerous experimental and calculational comparisons performed in recent years show that FLYCHK provides meaningful estimates of ionization distributions, well within a charge state for most laboratory applications.},

abstract = {The ENDF/B-VII.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of ENDF/B-VII.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the US Cross Section Evaluation Working Group (CSEWG) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of JENDL-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 MeV neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the ENDF/B-VII.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the VII.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for VII.0 for a wide range of MCNP simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 keV are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for ENDF/B-VII.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the ENDF/B-VII.0 publication. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to establish a three-dimensional (3-D) in vitro model system of cardiac muscle for electrophysiological studies. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cells containing lower or higher fractions of cardiac myocytes were cultured on polymeric scaffolds in bioreactors to form regular or enriched cardiac muscle constructs, respectively. After 1 wk, all constructs contained a peripheral tissue-like region (50-70 {micro}m thick) in which differentiated cardiac myocytes were organized in multiple layers in a 3-D configuration. Indexes of cell size (protein/DNA) and metabolic activity (tetrazolium conversion/DNA) were similar for constructs and neonatal rat ventricles. Electrophysiological studies conducted using a linear array of extracellular electrodes showed that the peripheral region of constructs exhibited relatively homogeneous electrical properties and sustained macroscopically continuous impulse propagation on a centimeter-size scale. Electrophysiological properties of enriched constructs were superior to those of regular constructs but inferior to those of native ventricles. These results demonstrate that 3-D cardiac muscle constructs can be engineered with cardiac-specific structural and electrophysiological properties and used for in vitro impulse propagation studies.},

abstract = {The term ''fast pyrolysis'' has been used to describe a pyrolysis regime in which vapor production is enhanced and char minimized by rapid heating. It has been found in the last decade that high yields of primary pyrolysis oil can be achieved using fast pyrolysis. More recently it has been found that the pyrolysis vapors can be converted to high grade fuels using a catalyst. This makes fast pyrolysis of biomass desirable for synthetic fuel manufacture. The authors present results derived from the Diebold Integrated Kinetic Model (DKM) that predict the time, the temperature, and the products of pyrolysis and the heat for pyrolysis of cellulose as a function of heating rates between 0.01 and 10/sup 5/C/min. This range covers very slow pyrolysis requiring days to fast pyrolysis occurring in fractions of a second. The predictions are in good qualitative agreement with experimental measurements. They then compare the heat flux required for slow and fast pyrolysis for particles with that which can be obtained with practical heating devices. The comparison shows that convective and radiative heat transfer is adequate for fast pyrolysis of small particles, but not for large particles, due to conduction to the interior.},

abstract = {Summary
Bacteria that adhere to implanted medical devices or damaged tissue can encase themselves in a hydrated matrix of polysaccharide and protein, and form a slimy layer known as a biofilm. Antibiotic resistance of bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth contributes to the chronicity of infections such as those associated with implanted medical devices. The mechanisms of resistance in biofilms are different from the now familiar plasmids, transposons, and mutations that confer innate resistance to individual bacterial cells. In biofilms, resistance seems to depend on multicellular strategies. We summarise the features of biofilm infections, review emerging mechanisms of resistance, and discuss potential therapies.},

The irradiated target isotopes were 27Al, 41K, 47Ti, 51V, 54Fe, 59Co, 58,61Ni, 65Cu, 67Zn, 69Ga, 79Br, 92Mo, 93Nb, and 96Ru. The cross sections for 41K (n, p) 41Ar, 61Ni (n, p) 61Co, 65Cu (n, p) 65Ni, 67Zn (n, p) 67Cu, 79Br (n, p) 79mSe, 96Ru (n, p) 96m+gTc, and 69Ga (n, $\alpha$) 66Cu reactions were obtained for the first time. Irradiation was from the d-D neutron source of the Fusion Neutronics Source at the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute. All cross section values were determined relative to those of the 115In (n, n′) 115mIn reaction. To obtain reliable activation cross sections, careful attention was paid to correct neutron irradiation and to correct the measurement of induced activity as well as to determine the mean neutron energy at the irradiation positions. To measure weak activity levels, a highly efficient measuring technique with a well-type High Purity Germanium detector was applied to the activities. The present results were compared against the comprehensive evaluated data in JENDL-3.3,-3.2, and-Activation File 96 as well as in ENDF/B-VI, and FENDL/A-2.0. We concluded that the evaluated data for 41K (n, p) 41Ar, 51V (n, p) 51Ti, 61Ni (n, p) 61Co, 79Br (n, p) 79mSe, 96Ru (n, p) 96m+gTc, 69Ga (n, $\alpha$) 66Cu, and 93Nb (n, $\alpha$) 90mY reactions were overestimated or underestimated by more than 30%.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground and purpose To improve precision of particle therapy, in vivo range verification is highly desirable. Methods based on prompt gamma rays emitted during treatment seem promising but have not yet been applied clinically. Here we report on the worldwide first clinical application of prompt gamma imaging (PGI) based range verification. Material and methods A prototype of a knife-edge shaped slit camera was used to measure the prompt gamma ray depth distribution during a proton treatment of a head and neck tumor for seven consecutive fractions. Inter-fractional variations of the prompt gamma profile were evaluated. For three fractions, in-room control {CTs} were acquired and evaluated for dose relevant changes. Results The measurement of {PGI} profiles during proton treatment was successful. Based on the {PGI} information, inter-fractional global range variations were in the range of ±2 mm for all evaluated fractions. This is in agreement with the control {CT} evaluation showing negligible range variations of about 1.5 mm. Conclusions For the first time, range verification based on prompt gamma imaging was applied for a clinical proton treatment. With the translation from basic physics experiments into clinical operation, the potential to improve the precision of particle therapy with this technique has increased considerably.},

abstract = {We present a hard X-ray spectrum of unprecedented quality of the Galactic supernova remnant (SNR) W49B obtained with the Suzaku satellite. The spectrum exhibits an unusual structure consisting of a saw-edged bump above 8 keV. This bump cannot be explained by any combination of high-temperature plasmas in ionization equilibrium. We firmly conclude that this bump is caused by the strong radiative recombination continuum (RRC) of iron, detected for the first time in a SNR. The electron temperature derived from the bremsstrahlung continuum shape and the slope of the RRC is $\sim$1.5 keV. On the other hand, the ionization temperature derived from the observed intensity ratios between the RRC and K$\alpha$ lines of iron is $\sim$2.7 keV. These results indicate that the plasma is in a highly overionized state. Volume emission measures independently determined from the fluxes of the thermal and RRC components are consistent with each other, suggesting the same origin of these components.},

@article{0034-4885-75-5-056401,
abstract = {For many years, laser-driven ion acceleration, mainly proton acceleration, has been proposed and a number of proof-of-principle experiments have been carried out with lasers whose pulse duration was in the nanosecond range. In the 1990s, ion acceleration in a relativistic plasma was demonstrated with ultra-short pulse lasers based on the chirped pulse amplification technique which can provide not only picosecond or femtosecond laser pulse duration, but simultaneously ultra-high peak power of terawatt to petawatt levels. Starting from the year 2000, several groups demonstrated low transverse emittance, tens of MeV proton beams with a conversion efficiency of up to several percent. The laser-accelerated particle beams have a duration of the order of a few picoseconds at the source, an ultra-high peak current and a broad energy spectrum, which make them suitable for many, including several unique, applications. This paper reviews, firstly, the historical background including the early laser–matter interaction studies on energetic ion acceleration relevant to inertial confinement fusion. Secondly, we describe several implemented and proposed mechanisms of proton and/or ion acceleration driven by ultra-short high-intensity lasers. We pay special attention to relatively simple models of several acceleration regimes. The models connect the laser, plasma and proton/ion beam parameters, predicting important features, such as energy spectral shape, optimum conditions and scalings under these conditions for maximum ion energy, conversion efficiency, etc. The models also suggest possible ways to manipulate the proton/ion beams by tailoring the target and irradiation conditions. Thirdly, we review experimental results on proton/ion acceleration, starting with the description of driving lasers. We list experimental results and show general trends of parameter dependences and compare them with the theoretical predictions and simulations. The fourth topic includes a review of scientific, industrial and medical applications of laser-driven proton or ion sources, some of which have already been established, while the others are yet to be demonstrated. In most applications, the laser-driven ion sources are complementary to the conventional accelerators, exhibiting significantly different properties. Finally, we summarize the paper.},

Astatine-211 can be produced in reasonable yield from natural bismuth targets via the (209)Bi( $\alpha$,2n)(211)At nuclear reaction utilizing straightforward methods. There is some debate as to the best incident $\alpha$-particle energy for maximizing (211)At production while minimizing production of (210)At, which is problematic because of its 138.4-day half life $\alpha$-particle emitting daughter, (210)Po. The intrinsic cost for producing (211)At is reasonably modest and comparable to that of commercially available (123)I. The major impediment to (211)At availability is attributed to the need for a medium energy $\alpha$-particle beam for its production. On the other hand, there are about 30 cyclotrons in the world that have the beam characteristics required for (211)At production.},

abstract = {The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) is an important molecular target for the visualization and therapy of tumors and can be targeted with radiolabeled bombesin derivatives. The present study aims to develop statine-based bombesin receptor antagonists suitable for labeling with 64Cu for imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). The potent GRPr antagonist d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 was conjugated to the sarcophagine (3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaazabicyclo[6.6.6] icosane = Sar) derivative 5-(8-methyl-3,6,10,13,16,19-hexaaza-bicyclo[6.6.6]icosan-1-ylamino)-5-oxopentanoic acid (MeCOSar) via PEG4 (LE1) and PEG2 (LE2) spacers and radiolabeled with 64Cu2+ with >95\% yield and specific activities of about 100 MBq/nmol. Both Cu(II) conjugates have high affinity for GRPr (IC50: natCu-LE1, 1.4 ± 0.1 nM; natCu-LE2, 3.8 ± 0.6 nM). The antagonistic properties of both conjugates were confirmed by Ca2+-flux measurements. Biodistribution studies of Cu-64-LE1 exhibited specific targeting of the tumor (19.6 ± 4.7\% IA/g at 1 h p.i.) and GRPr-positive organs. Biodistribution and PET images at 4 and 24 h postinjection showed increasing tumor-to-background ratios with time. This was illustrated by the acquisition of PET images showing high tumor-to-normal tissue contrast. This study demonstrates the high affinity of the MeCOSar-PEGx-bombesin conjugates to GRPr. The stability of 64Cu complexes of MeCOSar, the long half-life of 64Cu, and the suitable biodistribution profile of the 64Cu-labeled peptides lead to PET images of high contrast suitable for potential translation into the clinic.},

abstract = {Nuclear resonance fluorescence is able to non-intrusively interrogate a region space and measure the isotopic content of the material in that space for any element with atomic number greater than that of helium. The technique involves exposing material to a continuous energy distribution of photons and detecting the scattered photons that have a discrete energy distribution unique to an isotope. The interrogating photons, which range from 2 to 8 MeV, are the most penetrating probes and can “see” through many inches of steel. Determination of the chemical components of the material occupying a region of space greatly enhances the identification of threats such as explosives, fissile materials, toxic materials and weapons of mass destruction. Systems can be designed to involve minimal operator intervention, to minimize dose to the sample, and to provide high throughput at commercial seaports, airports and other entry points.},

The conversion ratioR=K/(L+M+...) was deduced from electron spectra recorded with the magnetic$\beta$-spectrometer.

The current generator design produces near monoenergetic 2.45 MeV neutrons at outputs of 10 8 n/s. Calculations provided show that future conditioning at higher currents and voltages will allow for a production rate over 10 10 n/s. A significant problem encountered was beam-induced electron backstreaming, that needed to be resolved to achieve meaningful beam currents. Two methods of suppressing secondary electrons resulting from the deuterium beam striking the target were tested: the application of static electric and magnetic fields. Computational simulations of both techniques were done using a finite element analysis in COMSOL Multiphysics R . Experimental tests verified these simulation results. The most reliable suppression was achieved via the implementation of an electrostatic shroud with a voltage offset of -800 V relative to the target.},

abstract = {In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power. },

abstract = {A new evaluation has been prepared of the independent & cumulative yields of the products of fission induced by thermal, fast, and 14 MeV neutrons in nuclides important for reactor design and operation and for fuel and waste management. Three spontaneously fissioning nuclides were also considered. The evaluation used a database that is considered to be complete up to early 1989. Careful study was made of experimental uncertainties and discrepancies, emphasizing the need for further measurements. Gaps in the data were filled by interpolation and extrapolation, using fits to empirical models. The yields were subsequently adjusted to fit physical constraints of the fissioning process. This paper describes the methods used in the evaluation, and includes graphs that illustrate the quality of the data. A computer library has been produced in ENDF/B-VI format giving yields from the neutron-induced fission of: 232Th, 233,234,235,236,238U, 237,238Np, 238,239,240,241,242Pu, 241,242m,243Am, and 243,244,245Cm, and from the spontaneous fission of 242,244Cm and 252Cf.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.High-spin gadolinium(III) and manganese(II) complexes have emerged as alternatives to standard nitroxide radical spin labels for measuring nanometric distances by using pulsed electron-electron double resonance (PELDOR or DEER) at high fields/frequencies. For certain complexes, particularly those with relatively small zero-field splitting (ZFS) and short distances between the two metal centers, the pseudosecular term of the dipolar coupling Hamiltonian is non-negligible. However, in general, the contribution from this term during conventional data analysis is masked by the flexibility of the molecule of interest and/or the long tethers connecting them to the spin labels. The efficient synthesis of a model system consisting of two [Mn(dota)]2- (MnDOTA; DOTA4-=1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate) directly connected to the ends of a central rodlike oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE) spacer is reported. The rigidity of the OPE is confirmed by Q-band PELDOR measurements on a bis-nitroxide analogue. The MnII-MnII distance distribution profile determined by W-band PELDOR is in reasonable agreement with one simulated by using a simple rotamer analysis. The small degree of flexibility arising from the linking MnDOTA arm appears to outweigh the contribution from the pseudosecular term at this interspin distance. This study illustrates the potential of MnDOTA-based spin labels for measuring fairly short nanometer distances, and also presents an interesting candidate for in-depth studies of pulsed dipolar spectroscopy methods on MnII-MnII systems.},

abstract = {Pretargeting involves administration of a tumor-targeting monoclonal antibody (mAb) covalently linked to a molecule having a high-affinity binding site for a rapidly distributed radiolabeled effector molecule. The aim of this study was to compare pretargeting to a conventionally labeled antibody for tumor targeting of the intermediate-lived radionuclide 64Cu, which has shown promise for PET imaging and radioimmunotherapy of cancer. Methods: DOTA-biotin (where DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N″,N‴-tetraacetic acid) and the intact immunoconjugate DOTA-NR-LU-10 were labeled to high specific activities with 64Cu, and the serum stabilities and target binding capabilities of each agent were assayed in vitro. Nude mice bearing SW1222 human colorectal carcinoma xenografts were administered 64Cu-DOTA-biotin, with and without pretreatment with the mAb-streptavidin conjugate NR-LU-10/SA and the synthetic clearing agent Biotin-GalNAc16, or injected with 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10. Biodistributions of both agents were obtained from 5 min to 48 h after injection. Results: Both 64Cu-DOTA-biotin and 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 were 100% stable in serum in vitro. 64Cu-DOTA-biotin exhibited >98% specific binding to immobilized streptavidin, whereas the immunoreactivity of 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 averaged nearly 80%. Biodistributions in SW1222-bearing mice showed that NR-LU-10/SA–pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin attained a peak tumor uptake of 18.9 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1 h, with concomitant rapid disappearance from blood and renal excretion. In the absence of pretargeting, 64Cu-DOTA-biotin had very similar biodistribution and clearance properties, except with extremely low nonspecific tumor uptake. In contrast, 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10 reached 80.3 %ID/g in tumor tissue, after 48 h, whereas blood clearance was considerably slower than pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin. Comparison of the time–activity curves for tumor uptake and blood clearance of pretargeted 64Cu and the 64Cu-labeled antibody revealed that the maximum tumor accumulations of radioactivity were similar for each agent, 17.9 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) and 20.7 %IA/g, respectively. However, the tumor-to-blood ratio of areas under the curves was 14 times higher for pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin because of the substantial increase in blood clearance of the small effector molecule. Conclusion: The extremely rapid tumor uptake and blood clearance of pretargeted 64Cu-DOTA-biotin should afford markedly superior PET imaging contrast and therapeutic efficacy, compared with conventionally labeled 64Cu-DOTA-NR-LU-10. Further comparison of the therapeutic efficacy, toxicity, and dosimetry of these 2 agents is warranted.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented for designing photobioreactors with tubular loop solar receivers in which the fluid is circulated by an airlift device. The design method effectively combines the relevant aspects of external irradiance-dependent cell growth, oxygen accumulation in the solar loop, oxygen removal in the airlift device, and hydrodynamics of the airlift system that determine the flow velocity through the solar receiver. The design approach developed was used to model and build a 0.2 m3 outdoor photobioreactor. A compact degasser in the airlift section eliminated dead zones and dark zones, while achieving complete separation of gas and liquid. The measured gas–liquid hydrodynamics, mass transfer, and culture productivity were consistent with the model predictions. The reactor was tested with continuous culture of the microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum at various liquid velocities through the tubular solar receiver. A biomass productivity of 1.20 g l−1 d−1 (or 20 g m−2 d−1) was obtained at a dilution rate of 0.050 h−1. Solar receiver linear liquid velocities of 0.50 and 0.35 m s−1 gave similar biomass productivities, but the culture collapsed at lower velocities. An adverse effect of high dissolved oxygen concentration on productivity was observed. Oxygen accumulation could be reduced by increasing the liquid velocity and this enhanced the biomass yield.},

@article{Koning2012,
abstract = {This paper presents a general overview of nuclear data evaluation and its applications as developed at NRG, Petten. Based on concepts such as robustness, reproducibility and automation, modern calculation tools are exploited to produce original nuclear data libraries that meet the current demands on quality and completeness. This requires a system which comprises differential measurements, theory development, nuclear model codes, resonance analysis, evaluation, ENDF formatting, data processing and integral validation in one integrated approach. Software, built around the TALYS code, will be presented in which all these essential nuclear data components are seamlessly integrated. Besides the quality of the basic data and its extensive format testing, a second goal lies in the diversity of processing for different type of users. The implications of this scheme are unprecedented. The most important are:. 1. Complete ENDF-6 nuclear data files, in the form of the TENDL library, including covariance matrices, for many isotopes, particles, energies, reaction channels and derived quantities. All isotopic data files are mutually consistent and are supposed to rival those of the major world libraries.2. More exact uncertainty propagation from basic nuclear physics to applied (reactor) calculations based on a Monte Carlo approach: "Total" Monte Carlo (TMC), using random nuclear data libraries.3. Automatic optimization in the form of systematic feedback from integral measurements back to the basic data. This method of work also opens a new way of approaching the analysis of nuclear applications, with consequences in both applied nuclear physics and safety of nuclear installations, and several examples are given here. This applied experience and feedback is integrated in a final step to improve the quality of the nuclear data, to change the users vision and finally to orchestrate their integration into simulation codes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The evaluated experimental data are presented for 14 known nuclides of mass 89 (Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Tc, Ru, Rh). New data on high-spin excitations are available for 89Kr, 89Rb, 89Sr, 89Tc and 89Ru, including a superdeformed structure in 89Tc. Fluorescence studies in 89Y have revealed a large number of new levels in 7-11 MeV range. New two-neutron transfer data are available for 89Zr. New direct and precise measurement of atomic masses of 89Se, 89Br, 89Kr, 89Rb, 89Mo and 89Tc have greatly improved the Q value landscape in this mass region. This work supersedes previous A=89 evaluation published in 1998Si31, and also the older ones 1989Si20, 1975Ko21, and M.W. Johns et al., Nuclear Data Tables A 8, 373 (1970).In spite of extensive experimental work on the isobaric nuclei of this mass chain several deficiencies remain. The identification of 89Rh isotope remains unconfirmed. The half-lives of ground states of 89Ge, 89As and 89Rh have not been measured, only the lower limits are estimated from time-of-flight in a reaction and experimental arrangement, where produced and identified. The decay schemes of 89Ge, 89As, 89Se, 89Ru and 89Rh are not known, and those for 89Tc and 89Mo are incomplete. High-lying (neutron unbound) levels in 89Kr, expected to be populated in the decay of 89Br, have not been investigated. The spins and parities for levels in 89Kr are largely unassigned, while for 89Tc and 89Ru, only few low-spin excitations are established. For 89Rb, little information is available for high-spin structures. Detailed gamma-ray data are available for 88Sr(n,??)89Sr reaction, but most of these ?? rays remain unassigned in a level scheme. Excited state data are nonexistent for 89Ge, 89As, 89Se, 89Br and 89Rh. The 89Y and 89Zr are the most extensively studied nuclei in A=89. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Advantages of vanadium alloys for fusion reactor structural applications are: low induced activation, excellent thermal stress factor, high strength at elevated temperatures, and superior ductility at low temperatures. Resistance to irradiation damage is also very impressive, i.e. very small DBTT shift by irradiation and low swelling. Research and development of vanadium alloys have made a remarkable progress in recent years partly supported by ITER-related activities. Composition range centered about V4Cr4Ti is the target of many of the studies conducted in the US, Japan and RF. Most of the studies have demonstrated the superior performance of this alloy family, while some alloys containing large amount of impurities have shown relatively poor properties. In addition to the baseline mechanical properties, neutron irradiation effects, e.g., swelling and radiation embrittlement are covered in this paper. Of particular importance is the study of the effects of dynamically-charged helium on mechanical properties and swelling. Recent developments of insulator coatings and welding are also covered. The importance of mechanistic studies of the damage behavior is emphasized for efficient alloy development and prediction of materials life in service.},

abstract = {AbstractIntroduction The significance of nuclear data in the choice and medical application of a radionuclide is considered: the decay data determine its suitability for organ imaging or internal therapy and the reaction cross section data allow optimisation of its production route. A brief discussion of reaction cross sections and yields is given. Standard radionuclides The standard SPECT, {PET} and therapeutic radionuclides are enumerated and their decay and production data are considered. The status of nuclear data is generally good. Some existing discrepancies are outlined. A few promising alternative production routes of 99mTc and 68Ga are discussed. Research-oriented radionuclides The increasing significance of non-standard positron emitters in organ imaging and of low-energy highly-ionizing radiation emitters in internal therapy is discussed, their nuclear data are considered and a brief review of their status is presented. Some other related nuclear data issues are also mentioned. Production of radionuclides using newer technologies The data needs arising from new directions in radionuclide applications (multimode imaging, theranostic approach, radionanoparticles, etc.) are considered. The future needs of data associated with possible utilization of newer irradiation technologies (intermediate energy cyclotron, high-intensity photon accelerator, spallation neutron source, etc.) are outlined. Conclusion Except for a few small discrepancies, the available nuclear data are sufficient for routine production and application of radionuclides. Considerable data needs exist for developing novel radionuclides for applications. The developing future technologies for radionuclide production will demand further data-related activities.},

New high-spin data are available for 86Se, 86Br, 86Kr, 86Sr, 86Y, 86Zr and 86Mo; and lifetime data for high-spin states in 86Y and 86Zr. No significant new data since the 2001 NDS for A=86 have been reported for 86Rb and 86Nb. No data are yet available for excited states in 86Ga and 86As. The decay scheme of radioactive 86Ge is unknown, while those for 86Ga, 86As, 47.4 min isomer of 86Y, 86Nb and 86Tc are deemed as incomplete. Isomerism in 86Nb remains unconfirmed.

abstract = {This design report describes an up-to-date benchmark thermochemical conversion process that incorporates the latest research from NREL and other sources. Building on a design report published in 2007, NREL and its subcontractor Harris Group Inc. performed a complete review of the process design and economic model for a biomass-to-ethanol process via indirect gasification. The conceptual design presented herein considers the economics of ethanol production, assuming the achievement of internal research targets for 2012 and nth-plant costs and financing. The design features a processing capacity of 2,205 U.S. tons (2,000 metric tonnes) of dry biomass per day and an ethanol yield of 83.8 gallons per dry U.S. ton of feedstock. The ethanol selling price corresponding to this design is $2.05 per gallon in 2007 dollars, assuming a 30-year plant life and 40% equity financing with a 10% internal rate of return and the remaining 60% debt financed at 8% interest. This ethanol selling price corresponds to a gasoline equivalent price of $3.11 per gallon based on the relative volumetric energy contents of ethanol and gasoline.},
