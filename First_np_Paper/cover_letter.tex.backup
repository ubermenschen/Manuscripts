\noindent This work described in this manuscript is a measurement of the cross sections for the \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc} and \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} reactions. This is part of a new, ongoing effort at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to address the gaps in existing nuclear data which have been identified by the applications community, focusing in particular on the production of novel and emerging medical radioisotopes. 

\noindent The methodology used to measure these cross sections involved neutron activation of metal foils, using the UC Berkeley High Flux Neutron Generator (HFNG), a compact DD neutron generator designed as a \enquote{flux-trap} that maximizes the probability that a neutron will interact with a sample loaded into a specific, central location. Target foils of zinc and titanium were irradiated with co-loaded indium foils.   Activating foils in ratio to indium removes the flux dependence from cross section measurements, which in turn eliminates  the largest source of uncertainty for cross section measurements. As a result, our cross sections  depend only on the relative detector efficiencies for the measured decay gamma rays, allowing for high-precision cross section measurements.


\noindent Several major novel contributions are reported in the present work. Most directly, the cross sections for the \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc} and \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} reactions have been measured to a lower uncertainty than existing empirical measurements. The work also provides the first detailed characterization of the energy spectrum of the  
HFNG. Most notably, the work  outlines the desirable characteristics of the HFNG for isotope production applications, and discusses a formalism describing the utility of it and other DD-based neutron generators for high-specific activity isotope production.

 
\noindent The attached manuscript is an original work which bears no significant overlap with any journal or conference papers published by any of the authors herein. Several previous measurements exist in the literature for both of the cross sections presented in this work, though our measurements have lower uncertainty than any previous measurements at the energy in this work. The most recent previous measurement of the \ce{^{64}Zn}(n,p)\ce{^{64}Cu} reaction was by Shimizu \emph{et. al.}\footnote{T. Shimizu, \emph{et. al.}, NIM A: 527 (3)
(2004) 543–553. doi:10.1016/j.nima.2004.03.184.}, and the most recent previous measurement of the \ce{^{47}Ti}(n,p)\ce{^{47}Sc} reaction was by  Shimizu \emph{et. al.}\footnote{T. Shimizu, \emph{et. al.}, Annals of Nuclear Energy 31 (9) (2004) 975–990. doi:10.1016/j.anucene.2003.12.005.}.

Several notable experts have been proposed as potential reviewers for this manuscript: Md. Uddin of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment, Bangladesh (\url{md.shuzauddin@yahoo.com}), Steve Wender of Los Alamos National Laboratory  (\url{wender@lanl.gov}), Ron Nelson of Los Alamos National Laboratory  	   (\url{rnelson@lanl.gov	}), Steven Yates of the University of Kentucky	  (\url{yates@uky.edu	}), Arjan Plompen of the Belgian Joint Research Centre	   (\url{Arjan.Plompen@ec.europa.eu	}), Roland Beyer of Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf	  (\url{roland.beyer@hzdr.de	}), and Zsolt Revay of the Technical University of Munich	  (\url{zsolt.revay@frm2.tum.de	}).  All of these individuals are highly experienced in the nuclear data community, and have many years of experience in nuclear reaction evaluation and cross section measurements.

As a physicist with a background in ion beam interactions and accelerator physics, I believe that Mark Breese would be the best-qualified editor to handle this paper during the review process. How
