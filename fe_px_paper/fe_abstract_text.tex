% Intermediate-energy proton beams are used to produce a wide range of radionuclides for use in medical treatments and research.  
% However, reaction modeling in this energy range remains largely untested, and there is a paucity of monitor reactions in this energy range needed to establish beam characteristics  for quantitative cross section measurements.  
% To address this need, a
A stack  of thin Fe 
% , Cu, and Al monitor 
foils was irradiated with  55\,MeV and 25\,MeV proton beams at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron,  to investigate the \ce{^{nat}Fe}(p,x)  nuclear reaction channels as a  pathway for low-energy production of the emerging non-standard PET radionuclides \ce{^{51}Mn} and \ce{^{52m,g}Mn}.

% A stacked target of natural Nb, Cu, and Al thin foils were irradiated by 100 MeV protons at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Isotope Production Facility.
% The irradiation was motivated by interest in the characterization of the \ce{^{93}Nb}(p,4n)\ce{^{90}Mo} reaction as a new monitor reaction standard for intermediate-energy protons.
A set of 34 measured  cross sections for  \ce{^{nat}Fe}(p,x), \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x), and  \ce{^{nat}Ti}(p,x) reactions between threshold and 55\,MeV, as well as three independent measurements of isomer branching ratios, are reported.

determine proton fluence, with all activities  quantified via HPGe spectrometry.
Variance minimization techniques were employed to reduce systematic uncertainties in proton energy and fluence, improving the reliability of these measurements. 
The measured cross sections are shown to be in excellent agreement with  literature values where they exist, and have been measured with improved precision compared with previous measurements.

\ce{^{nat}Fe}(p,x)\ce{^{49}Cr},\ce{^{51,52m,56}Mn},\ce{^{58m}Co} reactions, as well as the first measurement of the independent cross sections for    \ce{^{nat}Fe}(p,x)\ce{^{51}Cr},\ce{^{52g}Mn},\ce{^{58g}Co}.
