% Intermediate-energy proton beams are used to produce a wide range of radionuclides for use in medical treatments and research.  
% However, reaction modeling in this energy range remains largely untested, and there is a paucity of monitor reactions in this energy range needed to establish beam characteristics  for quantitative cross section measurements.  
% To address this need, a
A stack  of thin Fe 
% , Cu, and Al monitor 
foils was irradiated with  55\,MeV and 25\,MeV proton beams at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's 88-Inch Cyclotron,  to investigate the \ce{^{nat}Fe}(p,x)  nuclear reaction channels as a  pathway for low-energy production of the emerging non-standard PET radionuclides \ce{^{51}Mn} and \ce{^{52g}Mn}
% monitor for intermediate energy proton experiments and to benchmark state-of-the-art reaction model codes.
% A stacked target of natural Nb, Cu, and Al thin foils were irradiated by 100 MeV protons at the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Isotope Production Facility.
% The irradiation was motivated by interest in the characterization of the \ce{^{93}Nb}(p,4n)\ce{^{90}Mo} reaction as a new monitor reaction standard for intermediate-energy protons.
A set of 38 measured  cross sections for  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x) and  \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x) reactions between 40--90\,MeV, as well as 5 independent measurements of isomer branching ratios, are reported.

\ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{56}Co}, \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{62}Zn}, and \ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{65}Zn}  reactions were used to
determine proton fluence, and all activities were quantified using HPGe spectrometry.
Variance minimization techniques were employed to reduce systematic uncertainties in proton energy and fluence, improving the reliability of these measurements. 
The measured cross sections are shown to be in excellent agreement with  literature values, and have been measured with improved precision compared with previous measurements.
This work also reports the first measurement of the  \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x)\ce{^{82m}Rb} reaction, and of the independent cross sections for

\ce{^{nat}Cu}(p,x)\ce{^{52\text{g}}Mn} and \ce{^{nat}Nb}(p,x)\ce{^{85\text{g}}Y} in the 40--90\,MeV region.
